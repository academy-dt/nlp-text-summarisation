    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- indiana 's controversial religious freedom law has been in hot water lately . after a firestorm of backlash and protests , gov. mike pence said on tuesday that the state will `` fix '' the religious freedom restoration act , or rfra , so it will not discriminate against gays and lesbians . pence is making the right call . promoting the false dichotomy between protecting religion versus protecting equality serves no one . not all people who dislike the law hate religion , and not all people who like the law want to discriminate against the lgbt community . if people of good will come together , liberty and equality can both be saved . the unbelievably easy way to fix indiana 's rfra is to add one small amendment , one easy line codifying that discrimination against the lgbt community is harmful , and that there is a compelling governmental interest in eliminating that harm . in general , it is a good thing for society to shape its laws in ways that allow people to live their lives consistent with their sincerely held religious obligations . as americans , we value and always have valued the freedom and expression of religion . sometimes , a law seems to impose only modest burdens on the people it affects , but in practice it actually severely burdens the religious practices of a few . in those situations , if there is no compelling governmental interest in enforcing that law in that particularly burdensome way -- and if no one else is harmed -- then religion should be granted an exemption . shifting the burden to the government to prove that it really does need to apply this law in this particular way will not allow every person to become a law unto themselves ; it simply sends the message that religion is important , and unless there are specific and compelling reasons why , people should be allowed to practice as they need . these are the reasons why the federal rfra was passed in 1993 , and why it had bipartisan support . these are wholesome american values that everyone can get behind . the problem is that we no longer live in 1993 , 10 years before lawrence v. texas , and 20 before u.s. v. windsor . in 1993 , our sensibilities were different ; there was not yet a national conversation about the need to protect the rights and dignity of members of the lgbt community . timing matters because society changes , and now that our horizons have been broadened we can not just keep insisting that the law was never intended to discriminate and worked just fine 22 years ago , before we realized its negative potential . even if not a single lawmaker consciously intends the bill to be used as a shield for discrimination , we still have to take seriously justice oliver wendell holmes ' claim about unintended consequences . to put it simply , you have to be concerned with what the law allows a person to get away with . the concern is real . because indiana does not have a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation , the bill as drafted might allow people who were so inclined to discriminate , and simply assert that they could do so based on a religious belief . public perceptions matter . whether or not lawmakers think so , it certainly seems relevant to the general public that this bill was passed with important national decisions about marriage equality on the horizon and right after the ruling in baskin v. bogans that indiana 's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional . writing for the seventh circuit panel in 2014 , judge richard posner 's rationale in the case of baskin v. bogan provides the obvious answer for how to fix the rfra deficiency without changing what it is that it defends . courts have long held that a religious exemption can not be granted if it allows you to shift the harm to a third party , and -- as posner explained so simply -- discrimination is harmful . rfras are not inherently evil . the message can be nondiscriminatory and religion can be protected . the principles of rfra can remain unchanged ; it is just the definition of harmful that evolves . a few simple words have the potential to completely change the conversation , send an important message about the value of equality , and make indiana into a shining beacon of cooperation : the real `` crossroads of america . '' doing so would go a long way toward restoring its reputation as a place of great opportunity for all to live and worship and work .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- this is the time of the year when christians the world over -- more than 2 billion of us -- reflect upon the crucifixion and resurrection of our lord . in light of the tragic massacre of christian college students in kenya on thursday , and the ongoing threat against christians in other nations , this holy week we are calling upon christians to also reflect upon the crucifixion , beheading , stoning , enforced slavery , sexual abuse , human trafficking , harassment , bombing and displacement of hundreds of thousands of christians -- and others -- whose faith alone has made them a target of religious extremists . countless lives have been utterly destroyed in nations such as iraq , syria , libya , pakistan , india , egypt , kenya and nigeria . in june 2012 , bishop shlemon warduni of iraq told the united states conference of catholic bishops , `` we beg you to help . we want only peace , security , and freedom . please no more death , no more explosions , no more injustice . '' by then , nearly every remaining church in iraq had constructed a blast wall around its building to buffet the threat of the inevitable church bombing . this crisis escalated substantially last summer when isis swept like lightning through iraq 's nineveh province , capturing the country 's second-largest city , mosul ; a city that was until 2014 a home of a thriving christian community , there centuries before islam . again and again the world did not respond as it might have , and now the inconceivable has happened : iraq 's nineveh plain has been emptied of its ancient christianity community , which existed there for more than 1,500 years . on march 27 , in a presentation to the u.n. security council , chaldean catholic patriarch louis raphael sako referred to the present reality of his fellow iraqi christians as a `` catastrophic situation . '' he 's right . rarely since the first century has the church in the east faced persecution on this scale . christian communities that took 2,000 years to build , and that were started by the apostles themselves , lie in ashes between the tigris and the euphrates . survivors waste away as refugees , often in deplorable conditions , with no homes or churches to return to if the region eventually stabilizes . whether they be catholic , orthodox or protestant , christian communities are united in what pope francis has called an `` ecumenism of blood , '' recognizing that christianity is experiencing more martyrdom today than in the first century . this is not an exaggerated or contrived crisis . as nina shea , director of the hudson 's institute 's center for religious freedom , has aptly put it , `` piece by piece , middle eastern christianity is being shattered . '' our concern is not to the exclusion of anyone else under threat by these religious fanatics , and we reject those who believe that this evil is reflective of the majority of muslims whose community has actually experienced the most casualties in this conflict . it is also true that christianity faces a legitimate threat of extinction in several parts of iraq and syria and it faces a growing threat in nations such as nigeria . in solidarity with those being threatened we agree with the words delivered by jordan 's king abdullah ii at the united nations last fall , `` christians are an integral part of -lsb- the middle east 's -rsb- past , present and future . '' when history writes of our time will we be able to say that we tried everything in our power to cease this attempt to eliminate 2,000 years of christianity from the middle east and to stop this threat before it spreads to other nations ? these communities need our love and support like never before , and they also need security and protection from the world like never before . this easter we reflect upon the words of a christian who was himself beheaded for his faith alone . he converted to christianity one day on a road to damascus , syria , when his name was changed from saul to paul . in a letter to christians living in another dangerous place in another persecuted time , he wrote , `` pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil people . '' this easter , let us earnestly pray with all the love of christ for all those in harm 's way .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- the last time muhammadu buhari came to power in nigeria , it was by force . this time it was by the ballot box . here are five reasons why one of the most fiercely-contested elections in the country 's history is so important . for the first time in nigeria 's history , the opposition defeated the ruling party in democratic elections . muhammadu buhari , 72 , won nigeria 's presidential election , defeating incumbent goodluck jonathan by about two million votes . nigeria is significant because it is the biggest economy and most populous country in africa ; it is also one of africa 's largest oil producers and is a major supplier of crude oil to the united states . this is n't buhari 's first time leading nigeria -- but it 's his first time in nearly 30 years . the reformed dictator is a sunni muslim from nigeria 's poorer north , while jonathan comes from a christian and animist south that is rich with oil . buhari 's win comes after a long history of military rule , coups and botched attempts at democracy in the country . many nigerians told cnn that they saw president jonathan as an ineffectual leader who was indecisive in dealing with the terror group boko haram -- and weak on corruption . buhari , who was campaigning for the fourth time , capitalized on these weaknesses and some analysts believe that his military background was an advantage for him . nigerians wanted a strong leader who could keep them safe from boko haram 's murderous raids -- and buhari also campaigned as a born-again democrat to allay fears about his strict military regime the last time around . he stressed that nigeria 's security needs to be the next government 's focus . his campaign was also fiercely anti-corruption -- he ran under the slogan of `` new broom , '' and his supporters were often pictured holding brooms in the lead-up to the vote . the elections were largely predicted to be violent and everyone , nigerians included , expected the worst . some families moved abroad and there was sporadic violence across the country in the lead up to the election . but those fears turned out to be mostly unfounded , and the elections held relatively peacefully -- with the exception of attacks in the north of the country , where around 11 people died . many also praised president jonathan 's gracious and quick concession of defeat as it almost certainly prevented post-election violence . president-elect buhari said wednesday in a speech to the nation : `` the eyes of the world were focused on us to see if we can vote in a peaceful way and carry out elections in an orderly manner . `` we have proven to the world that we are a people who have embraced democracy and a people who seek a government by , for and for the people . '' on election day , nigerians queued for hours in hot weather to cast their vote . some of the biometric reader machines malfunctioned -- including the one at president jonathan 's polling station -- and voting had to be extended into the following day . but the technical issues did n't keep people from voting -- and in lagos , some voters cast their ballots with the aid of the light from their mobile phones . and even though some card readers did n't work in some places , many say they helped to cut down on vote rigging . boko haram is n't the only obstacle facing the new president . the economy , crime and generating enough power to light up the country are other major issues . the pressure will soon be on buhari to deliver and there will be no excuses . if he fails , nigerians will be waiting for him at the polls just four short years from now .",

'' it 's time for mcdonald 's to make sure all the people who serve its burgers are paid enough to afford to eat them for dinner . but we are n't going to wait for divine intervention . we 're going to keep organizing and keep fighting until the workers at mcdonald 's , and every other fast-food restaurant , get what makes sense for their families and our communities : a $ 15 per hour wage and a path to form a union without interference or retaliation . mcdonald 's took a small step forward by raising wages for a small minority of the people who run their stores . it 's time for the corporation to find a way to raise wages for everyone working in its restaurants so they can pay their bills , put some money back into their community , and expand prosperity and opportunity across our land .",

'' the suspect ran five city blocks before being tracked down , carrying a loaded handgun . he did n't go easily , refusing to identify himself . but when chicago police contacted their law enforcement counterparts about 60 miles south in kankakee county and told them about the tattoo , it became clearer who the man was . as bukowski said of the gertrude tattoo , `` it 's not a common name to have around your neck . '' fingerprints later confirmed that chicago police had indeed caught up with taylor . while not offering details beyond that no one is thought to have driven him north nor did a tipster call to specify his location , bukowski did say `` we have some ideas of where he went and how he ended up '' in the windy city . it was n't immediately known either when taylor will return to kankakee county . but , when he does , the sheriff said the convict will likely face an attempted murder charge for his attack of the jail guard on top of his already extensive criminal history . murderer overpowers guard , drives off in his suv . bukowski said he expects that taylor will eventually be incarcerated outside kankakee county , in part because `` you do n't want someone to raise '' the idea that guards there might somehow seek retaliation for the attack on one of their own . what the sheriff does n't want is for taylor to go free ever again . this is a man , after all , who killed a man in a june 2013 botched robbery , had to be wrestled to the ground by bailiffs after his conviction in late february , then escaped jail after assaulting the guard . `` he 's not going to walk down the block again , i do n't believe , '' bukowski said . the assaulted correctional officer remains in an illinois hospital , where his condition has improved and he 's been able to talk to fellow authorities . this qualifies as very good news , given that authorities think taylor `` believed that he had killed that correctional officer by strangling him '' around 3 a.m. -lrb- 4 a.m. et -rrb- wednesday , according to the sheriff . the guard was making his rounds when he was attacked from the side , then severely beaten and choked . taylor then allegedly disrobed the guard , a military veteran and 10-year employee of the corrections department . the guard was left on the jail floor , going in and out of consciousness , for about 35 minutes before authorities -- concerned because the guard had n't responded to calls -- found him , the sheriff said . the alleged attacker then walked out of the jail , albeit only after having his identity checked by camera after pushing a button to notify `` master control '' that he wanted to leave . `` we think that because he had the officer 's uniform on , '' the sheriff explained this week , `` that 's how he was able to effectively escape . '' now that taylor is once again locked up , the focus has shifted more to how he left in the first place . opining that the escape would n't have occurred `` if everybody had followed protocol , '' bukowski said it 's believed the inmate was n't in his cell at lockdown . `` that 's where the big mistake happened , '' the sheriff said . `` someone missed that . and from that point on , things broke down .

'' in their research , published in the journal `` plos one , '' the archaeologists said ottoman troops had besieged the area around tulln in 1683 as they tried to reach vienna , but that tulln itself had never been conquered . the ottoman army had a `` camelry , '' using camels for transportation and to ride , they said . despite their city not falling , tulln inhabitants and the ottomans were in contact , with historic documents referring to the invading army 's peaceful surrender of two prisoners of war , the researchers said . but they said it would be impossible to say how it got into the city . `` its appearance might be linked to an exchange of local people with the troops or the ottoman army simply left it behind . apparently , the citizens took it inside the town , where they probably kept and displayed it as an ` exotic animal , ' '' they said . `` it seems quite conceivable that being not familiar with behavioral and feeding habits , the scarcity of food in wartimes , people did not keep it for long . '' while other camel bones have been found in central europe , the researchers said this was unique . `` it is the first complete camel skeleton found in central europe and central european territories under the control of the ottoman empire , apart from the complete skeleton of a dromedary recovered from the sediments of the theodosius harbor on the european part of istanbul . '' dna analysis on the tulln skeleton confirmed that it had been one of a hybrid species of camel , specifically a `` tulu , '' the offspring of dromedary female and a male with bactrian dna . `` the two species are able to interbreed , which results in larger , more powerful and efficient hybrid offspring , '' researchers said . `` the camel specimen from tulln is the first archaeozoologically and genetically confirmed evidence of a tulu hybrid camel . '' the camel was also believed to have been castrated to make it easier to handle . the austrians ' unfamiliarity with such a beast may have led to the skeleton 's preservation . as opposed to the ottoman troops -- who would likely have eaten the camel 's flesh -- the residents of tulln apparently buried the camel whole . `` the dismemberment of the carcasses certainly is a reason for the scarce preservation of camel finds in general and is indicated by bones with butchering marks in particular . however , the citizens buried this camel in a typical post-mortal position , and together with rubbish in the remnants of a cellar that was leveled , '' researchers said . in their report , the researchers said the camel was found on the site of what had been an old tavern called `` auf der rossmuhle . '' `` the backfill of the cellar yielded masses of domestic refuse like animal bones and ceramics -lrb- e.g. plates , pans and flagons -rrb- , pieces of a tiled stove and enameled pipe bowls which date the filling in the early modern period , '' they said . a coin dating from 1643-1715 and a medicine bottle from a chemist 's operating from 1628-1665 helped the team date the site . flooding and plagues affected tulln in the 17th century and many buildings were demolished , they said . `` two building plots got new owners at the end of the century around the 1690 , certainly the time when the cellar was backfilled , offering enough space to bury such a big cadaver in the center of the town , '' their report explains . `` the skeleton remained there for more than 300 years to raise questions in the future .

'' over the weekend , bishop became the first australian government minister to visit iran in 12 years , meeting with president hassan rouhani . the intelligence-sharing deal was announced in an interview released monday that bishop gave to the australian broadcasting corporation while in tehran . `` during my discussions with the national leadership here , it was agreed that we could share intelligence , particularly on the foreign terrorist fighters from australia who are taking part in this conflict in iraq , '' she said . the iranians `` were very agreeable to share that information with us , '' she added . like many western nations , australia is grappling with the problem of citizens who are choosing to travel to iraq and syria to join isis , which calls itself the islamic state . australia is part of the u.s.-led coalition that 's carrying out airstrikes against isis . during the fight against the sunni extremist group , the coalition has found its interests aligned at times with those of iran , a shiite-majority nation that has strong ties with the iraqi government . iran-backed shiite militias played an important role in the recent battle to take the iraqi city of tikrit from isis jihadists . `` iran has a long standing relationship with iraq , and as you point out , they have a very strong military presence there . they also have an influence over the shia militia who are operating within iraq , '' she said . `` so they are in iraq , in places that we are not . they also have a very sophisticated intelligence network and they have a lot of information that they 've been gathering .

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- i 've been a chef in some form or another since i was 14 years old , but i did n't become a food activist until much later . it was 2007 , and a young girl my wife mentored was found rooting through the trash just to find something to eat . that inspired me to found food policy action and become politically active in a range of food issues , from hunger to factory farms . of course , i have n't been alone in this work . one of the biggest catalysts has been `` the meatrix , '' a 2003 animation parody based on `` the matrix '' and produced by the grace communications foundation , which crystallized the public health risks and environmental harms of factory farming . recently , `` the meatrix : relaunched '' came out . much more than a comical redux , it 's an important benchmark in the evolution of the sustainable food movement and compels us to look back at how far we 've come over the last decade -- and how far we still have to go . a decade ago , concepts like `` sustainable farming , '' `` animal welfare '' and `` organic food '' were considered fringe . while some consumers were beginning to take interest in where their meat and produce came from , public knowledge of sustainable food was limited . the standard gut-wrenching images of animal cruelty and sickly calves were ineffectual and mostly turned people off instead of urging them to make better food choices . meanwhile , factory farms continued to reap large profits while producing subpar meat , polluting air and water resources , and damaging the public 's health . to be sure , america 's food system is complex , and some may argue that industrial farming has been a necessity to meet our country 's food needs . however , the quality of our food has been sacrificed at this supposed altar of necessity , as industrial farms reap enormous profits that they direct toward lobbying rather than improving the quality of food they produce . in 2014 alone , the biggest meatpackers and their trade groups spent a combined $ 4.3 million on lobbyists . and it has paid off for them : factory farms often avoid penalties for the damage they cause to the environment and public health ; and they receive ridiculous subsidies from the u.s. government that totaled $ 58.7 million in 2012 , according to the environmental working group . these factors drive down the cost of industrially sourced meat at a rate that smaller farms ca n't keep up with . and since the actual costs of industrially raised meat are hidden , humanely raised meat appears expensive by comparison . that 's neither fair nor safe . we all deserve to know where the food we eat comes from and that it is wholesome , and we need our elected officials to take a stand against big agri-businesses to quit letting them profit off of meat and produce that jeopardize the health of the environment and the public . it 's time that consumer demand for sustainable and humane food trumps the power that industrial farms hold over our elected officials . the original `` meatrix '' cartoon used pop culture references and family-friendly cartoons to educate consumers about the dangers of factory farming , compel them to make better food choices and spark a wave of online advocacy for better government oversight of big agriculture and meat companies . as a result , it became one of the first viral videos ever to effectively expose consumers to the realities happening behind the doors of industrial farms and the damage these facilities were doing to the environment , our public health and surrounding communities . the rise in consumer knowledge has led to an increased demand for sustainably sourced food that is healthier and tastes better . grace has relaunched the eat well guide , an online directory of 25,000 sustainable farms , restaurants , food co-ops and farmers ' markets that allows consumers to make better choices about the food they eat and provide for their families . and we at food policy action have produced a legislative scorecard . we need to ask members of congress to promote sustainable farming , not factory farms . we need them to support sensible food policies that ensure that everyone has access to food and water . congress should vote against the dark act , which would block any federal or state action that required labels for foods made with genetically engineered ingredients even at the expense of the environment , public health and local economies . as more consumers are educated , they have the power to take action and call on elected officials to support sustainable farmers , not factory farms . together , we can create a sustainable food system in america that is better for our environment and our health .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- back in 1989 , ayatollah khomeini famously said he was `` drinking poison '' when he accepted a ceasefire to end the eight-year-old war with iraq . the war had helped define khomeini 's regime , the islamic republic , which he had founded a year before saddam hussein invaded iran . khomeini galvanized the nation , both his supporters and growing opponents , to fight against the enemy . he dragged out the war for eight years , despite saddam 's willingness to accept a ceasefire , and thus stabilized the foundations of the islamic republic . by the time he ended the war , the economy was in shambles , and there was no sign of his die-hard volunteers . since then , `` drinking a chalice of poison '' has became part of iranian political lexicon , and many analysts have asked whether ayatollah ali khamenei , khomeini 's successor , would raise the chalice and surrender to demands by the west to end iran 's nuclear program . like the war , iran 's defiance to halt its controversial nuclear program has defined khameni 's era . he has defied the west in the face of increasing economic pressure . iran claims that its program is peaceful , but khamenei 's refusal to end uranium enrichment activities -- a process that can lead to making nuclear fuel as well as nuclear bombs -- has landed the country under crippling sanctions . the standoff with the west has stretched longer than the war . the agreement reached in lausanne , switzerland , however , marks a new chapter in the history of the country . if iran can finalize a deal by june with the united states and its p5 +1 partners , international investors , including americans , would be able to invest in iran for the first time in decades . iran can develop its gas and oil fields , and the economy can leap forward . desperate for a deal , whoever i called over the past week inside iran was glued to their television sets , and tens of thousands poured out on the streets to celebrate the agreement late thursday night . iran 's economy shrank after sanctions were intensified in 2012 and the value of the rial , the iranian currency , plunged to one-third of the u.s. dollar . inflation soared and the bank accounts of ordinary iranians were frozen overseas as a result of sanctions . millions of iranians are hoping that their lives will improve in the post-deal era . despite the regime 's propaganda that claimed the program enjoys wide support among people , critics inside the country publicly denounced nuclear policies . ahmad shirzad , a former member of parliament , denounced the program last year and said it had been `` against national interests . '' another critic , sadeq ziba , said in december `` the nuclear program has hurt the country more than the war . '' iranian politicians are divided between moderates -- led by president hassan rouhani , who wants to develop the economy -- and hardliners , who view the deal as a threat to the regime 's ideology . the majority of people brought rouhani to power in 2012 , hoping that he would ease the sanctions . many see the negotiations as a diplomatic necessity that would help sideline hardliners too . yet the lausanne agreement would not have been possible without the moderates ' will and khamenei 's approval . ayatollah khamenei is 76 . last year , he underwent a long prostate surgery , which led to rumors that he might be gravely ill . his predecessor ended the war a year before his death . whether khamenei is seriously ill or not , many believe that because of his advanced age , he needs to put the country on a straight path before his death . so far , the regime has presented the deal as a win for itself . during 18 months of negotiations , the regime appeared determined not to succumb to western demands and lose its right to uranium enrichment . the lausanne agreement allows iran to spin 5,000 centrifuges and avoid national humiliation . khamenei can claim that iran is the winner in the country 's decade-long confrontation with the west -- a legacy that he wants to leave behind . he has not drunk the poison yet , not until june , when negotiators aim to iron out the final deal . but perhaps he has raised the chalice .",

    "article": "kiev , ukraine -lrb- cnn -rrb- the question haunting kiev is this : who might be murdering allies of ukraine 's ousted president viktor yanukovych ? the idea that this might be happening is not entirely new . but it muscled its way to the fore again this week with two high-profile shooting deaths in the ukrainian capital -- one of a former member of parliament with ties to yanukovych , the other of a ukrainian journalist known for his pro-russian views . oleg kalashnikov , the former member of parliament , was shot and killed shortly after 7 p.m. wednesday at the entrance to his apartment block . kalashnikov , 52 , was a member of the party of regions , the former ruling party in ukraine , and was close to yanukovych . police are investigating the death as a murder . a day later , on thursday , journalist oles buzyna , 45 , was killed near his home by shots fired from a dark blue ford focus , interior ministry adviser anton herashchenko said . the car 's license plates were reported to have been from either latvia or belorussia . the killings renewed speculation , sparked by earlier unusual deaths , about a conspiracy to kill people close to yanukovych . at least three former members of parliament with the party of regions have reportedly committed suicide in the last seven weeks : . \u2022 on february 28 , mikhail chechetov reportedly jumped from the window of his 17th-floor apartment in kiev , having left a suicide note . he was suspected of having falsified the results of a parliamentary vote in early 2014 that essentially prohibited protest just as thousands of people were protesting against the yanukovych government . \u2022 on march 9 , stanislav melnik , a former member of parliament with the party of regions and the manager of several businesses in the separatist-minded eastern city of donetsk , was found dead in his apartment near kiev . he , too , reportedly left a suicide note . \u2022 and three days later , on march 12 , oleksandr peklushenko , another former member of parliament , was found in his house in zaporizhzhya , in southeastern ukraine , dead of a gunshot wound . police are investigating various scenarios , including suicide . interior ministry adviser anton gerashchenko said peklushenko `` might have wanted to avoid punishment for using violence against protesters , which he was suspected of . '' ukraine is deeply divided , and it has been for years . about a third of the population speaks russian as opposed to ukrainian . whether the country should be drawn into the orbit of russia or the west is a visceral issue , a question for many ukrainians not of politics but of identity . recent events have deepened the divide . in 2014 , after yanukovych turned his back on the european union in favor of closer ties with russia , he was driven from office by mass demonstrations . and with russia 's subsequent annexation of crimea and its support for russian-speaking separatists in eastern ukraine , the internecine animosity made the ugly transformation into war . with a government toppled and armed conflict in the east , ukrainians have reason to want each other dead . but the view of who might be responsible for the series of deaths differs starkly , according to which side of the country 's divide one is on . the opposition bloc , the country 's major opposition party , has no doubt the deaths have been politically motivated -- `` bloody terror against opposition politicians and journalists , '' the bloc 's media office called them . `` it is clear oppression of those who are not afraid to criticize the government , '' it said . the government , unsurprisingly , sees things differently . ukrainian president petro poroshenko , who came to office after yanukovych was ousted , has demanded an investigation of the killings of kalashnikov and buzyna , his media office said . `` it is evident that these crimes have the same origin , '' the media office quoted poroshenko as saying . `` their nature and political sense are clear . it is a deliberate provocation that plays in favor of our enemies . it is aimed at destabilizing the internal political situation in ukraine and discrediting the political choice of the ukrainian people . '' and anton geraschenko , an adviser to the country 's interior minister , took the theory one step further . `` it should not be excluded that the killings of oleg kalashnikov and olez buzyna were planned and organized from moscow and are a part of a plan to destabilize ukraine and further support anti-ukrainian mood in russian society , '' geraschenko said .",

    "article": "former pub landlord michael thorpe has had his conviction for illegally showing foreign footage of premier league games overturned after eight years . a pub landlord convicted of showing premier league football matches on foreign tv channels has won an eight-year legal battle to clear his name . michael thorpe says he has paid a heavy price for the lengthy fight to get his conviction quashed and has lost his pub as a result . mr thorpe , 55 , was convicted of showing a premier league game without having an agreement with official broadcasters in november 2006 at the stoke inn in plymouth , devon . he said he could not afford to pay sky tv 's rates for football matches , and opted instead to show albanian transmissions of matches , which he says he thought was legal . but he was convicted , fined and ordered to pay costs eight years ago , when screening the matches was still treated as a criminal offence . judge recorder nicolas gerasimidis has now upheld his appeal and overturned the conviction following a landmark european court ruling . his appeal took so long as he had to launch the case after the european court of justice found enforcing previous rules was anti-competitive . mr thorpe said he was ` overwhelmed ' that a judge and magistrates had upheld his appeal after all this time . but it is a bitter-sweet victory , as the long-running dispute cost him his business and his livelihood . he said : ` we put a lot of money into that pub and it went from a thriving business to absolutely zero . people stopped coming to the pub , it cost me my business . ' mr thorpe launched an appeal against his conviction soon after his trial , but the case was delayed by a similar test case which went as far as the european court of justice . the court ruled that having an exclusive system was a restraint of free trade and contrary to european law . but the landlord says the court action has seen him lose the stoke inn in plymouth which he used to run . mr thorpe 's appeal was further delayed until another case involving media protection services ltd , the company which took him to court on behalf of the premier league , but which no longer does so . mr thorpe was awarded his legal costs , which he paid privately , but he would not disclose the sum . the european court decision in 2012 cleared a landlady of a criminal conviction , but judges left the door open for court action against publicans by ruling pubs should get permission from the copyright owner before screening matches . the premier league has since been taking landlords to civil courts for breaching copyright , with some ordered to pay up to # 65,000 in costs . the league sends teams of investigators to pubs around the country to try and catch those screening games illegally . legal cases have been brought against 250 bars and pubs during the current football season . he said he does not know whether he can retrieve the # 1,000 fine and # 1,500 costs ordered by the magistrates . despite the decision , the premier league has insisted pubs still can not show foreign-tv footage of its games . since the european court decision , it is taking landlords to civil courts and suing them using copyright laws , which were not affected by the previous ruling . in 2012 , pub karen murphy landlady won a landmark legal battle to overturn her conviction for using foreign decoders instead of sky to show premier league football matches . ms murphy , who ran the red , white and blue pub in portsmouth , hampshire , bought games through a greek satellite broadcaster nova for # 800 a year instead of sky , which was then priced at # 700-a-month . the premier league took legal action against her mrs murphy and she was fined # 8,000 for dishonest reception of a television reception in 2006 . but a european court of justice ruling said having an exclusive system of tv rights was contrary to eu law and the high court overturned her conviction . a recent investigation by trade publication , the morning advertiser , quoted a pub landlord saying sky sports cost him # 16,000-a-year , compared to the # 300-per-year of screening it illegally . the decision came after portsmouth landlady karen murphy won a european court battle over her conviction . despite the ruling , the premier league can still take pub owners to civil courts over breach of copyright .",

    "article": "lucas -lrb- left -rrb- and liverpool captain steven gerrard during sunday 's all-star charity game at anfield . liverpool midfielder lucas leiva is looking to recapture what he considers his best form in two years after recovering from injury . the brazil international enjoyed a run of 16 starts in 19 matches from late november - which coincided with a marked improvement in the team 's results - until a groin problem in february 's merseyside derby saw him miss 10 games . he was an unused substitute in the defeat by manchester united immediately before the international break , their first in the league since mid-december , but played 90 minutes in sunday 's all-star charity game at anfield . lucas 's return to fitness could not have come at a more opportune moment , with captain steven gerrard suspended for three matches for his sending off against united , and the brazilian is hoping to slot back in seamlessly after injury halted what was turning into a good season personally . ' i was in a very good moment , probably the best moment in the last couple of years , and i had a good run of games , ' he said . ` the beginning of the season was n't good for me because i could n't play much , but as soon as i got back in the team i think i helped a lot . ' i do n't know if stevie 's suspension will change things because the team were playing well , but i need to be ready and there are a lot of games to play and the fa cup as well , so everyone will be needed . ' i need to be ready and if i get a chance again i need to be at the same level i was before i was injured . ' lucas attempts to spoil luis 's suarez 's return to anfield with a tackle in the charity match . fifth-placed liverpool head to arsenal on saturday knowing they can not realistically afford to lose if they are to keep pace with the top four , but in addition to gerrard 's absence they will also be missing centre-back martin skrtel , a virtual ever-present this season , after he was retrospectively banned for standing on united goalkeeper david de gea . ` martin is having a fantastic season again . he has been a very consistent player for us and losing him and stevie is hard to take , but if you want to be successful you ca n't rely on one or two players , ' lucas told liverpoolfc.com . ` both are very important players for us as one can change a game and the other gives us stability at the back , but we have other players as well who can step in . ` it 's always been the case for the group that if someone gets injured then someone will step in and do the job . ` that 's how it should be and we should n't be afraid we do n't have them . ` of course it 's going to be a big miss not having stevie and skrts , but we have to show we can cope for the three games and then we have them back ready to go again . ' lucas 's spoiling in midfield helped liverpool go on an impressive run before christmas . the brazilian is aiming to take advantage of gerrard 's absence in he next three games . lucas rejected the chance to have some time off during the international break in order to make sure he was fully fit for the resumption of the premier league . ' i feel great . leading up to the manchester united game i had a full week of training as well , so it 's been two weeks of full training , ' he said . ' i was available for the manchester united game , but probably was n't able to play the whole game . now i feel 100 per cent . ` of course it 's good to have a few days off , but i was away in brazil while i was having my treatment so it was the right decision to stay here and keep working during the international break . ` if you get too many days off you do n't get the sharpness and the rhythm of the training session and that 's what i was missing . ' i spoke with the staff and they prepared everything for me as well to make me feel as though i 'm in good condition , so it 's looking good and hopefully it will only get better . ` now it 's just a question of getting some minutes and training sessions , so that 's what i need and what i 'm having . ` leading into the arsenal game that 's going to be good , because i will have had three full weeks of training and i 'm looking forward to it .

' i was obviously at the back end of my career when kevin started and it looked like he was going to be an outstanding player . but i do n't think anyone could have foreseen how good he was going to be and how many things he would win and how much he would grow as a leader in the game . he 's been awesome . ' sinfield has been named in leeds ' 19-man squad for friday 's derby at castleford , but coach brian mcdermott will not rush his skipper back . ` i 'm not sure if he 's going to be fit for friday , ' mcdermott said . ` what we have got to make sure when kev does come back into the team is that he 's 100 per cent fit . ` sutcliffe 's played really well in these last couple of games . he 's held his own and in some parts of the games has played really well . ` it 's good to know that while kevin 's in recovery , sutty is doing a good job and getting more experience .

' i felt pretty sorry for the little guy , it tried so hard but failed at the last hurdle . ` it makes me wonder how they have stayed alive for so many millions of years . ` seeing its face struggling in the mud was priceless , i always laugh out loud when i look back at these photographs .

    "article": "the champions of england were smashed into submission at stade marcel michelin on saturday night , to further expose the vast gulf in clout between the aviva premiership clubs and their rich french rivals . this was a brutal mismatch and a shattering result , not just for the ambitious saints but for the english game as a whole . jim mallinder 's men are imperious in domestic rugby -- leading the league by 10 points -- but they were simply obliterated by the formidable top 14 giants . clermont are nigh-on invincible at home and northampton could do absolutely nothing to even fleetingly threaten their dominance in this raucous arena . even in the brief moments when the saints had the temerity to work up a head of steam and go through the phases , they were pounded back in the tackle and turned over time and time again . clermont winger noa nakaitaci -lrb- right -rrb- scores his second try against northampton . what unfolded was one-way carnage . france wing noa nakaitaci scoring two tries before half-time and nick abendanon , the ex-bath and england full-back , capped a masterful display with a break-away try from 90 metres out . all the while , brock james kept cranking up the points tally with supreme goal-kicking . aside from the misery of being dumped out of the champions cup in such emphatic fashion , the concern for the saints will be that this grim rout critically damages their confidence at a key stage of the season . for northampton and england , there may also be worries over two leading forwards , as courtney lawes failed to reappear after half-time and alex corbisiero went off , apparently suffering pain in his right knee . nick abendanon of clermont dives over to score a try at the stade marcel-michelin . it was over as a contest long before half-time . there was a pronounced intensity deficit between the sides from the off , with northampton losing the collisions and appearing somewhat sluggish in contrast to their fired up and energetic opponents . the procession began in the fifth minute when the saints conceded an early scrum penalty . james landed his first shot at goal and the hosts were on their way . there was so much pressure from clermont that it was just a matter of time before the northampton defence was breached . sure enough , the first try came in the 13th minute , as fritz lee blasted clear from a lineout on the right and he released wesley fofana . abendanon cast his magic over the saints defence to inspire comprehensive victory . the france centre was tackled in the 22 by lee dickson , but the attack continued at a furious tempo and , when nakaitaci carved inside off his left foot , he was half stopped , but managed to climb up off the turf , stretch and touch down . the try was confirmed by the tmo and converted by james . it did n't help the saints ' already bleak cause that they missed their first scoring chance . after courtney lawes had pinched a clermont lineout throw , the visitors won a penalty but stephen myler was off target with the kick . james landed another penalty , then came the two-try barrage which buried northampton 's hopes of a famous result . at the heart of the onslaught was abendanon . first , his break laid the platform for fofana to burst deep into enemy territory and after napolioni nalaga was tackled short of the line , the ball was switched right and james ' lofted pass sent nakaitaci over for his second try . northampton captain dylan hartley leads his team off the pitch after crushing defeat . james converted from a wide angle then two minutes before the break , the blitz continued . jonathan davies made ground in the centre , fofana picked out abendanon and he raced into space , drew the last defender and passed back inside for the home no 12 to charge clear and touch down . once again , james added the extras and the saints were sunk . after the break , james struck another penalty before abendanon made his long-range dash to the line in the 55th minute , for another converted try . eventually , with julien bonnaire in the sin-bin , alex waller crashed over to give northampton something to show for all their desperate toil , but it was far too little , far too late . the horse had bolted . the game was up .",

    "article": "comments : veteran broadcaster peter alliss has sparked controversy by claiming gender equality laws have backfired and ` b ***** ed up the game ' veteran broadcaster peter alliss has sparked controversy by claiming gender equality laws have backfired and ` b ***** ed up the game ' . alliss , 84 , has said that legislation designed to stop golf clubs from discriminating against female members has instead prompted a decline in women 's membership . some clubs had previously only allowed female members if they played at restricted times in return for a discounted membership fee . but the equality act 2010 , drafted by the previous labour government , ruled that this was illegal discrimination , which means that women must now have equal access to the course -- and pay the same membership rates as men . mr alliss , a former professional who is one of the game 's most decorated players , claimed that tens of thousands of members of the ladies ' golf union have deserted the organisation since the rules came into force . ` i 'm told the ladies ' golf union has lost 150,000 members since equality for women came in , ' mr alliss told the radio times . ` hundreds of women have left golf clubs because they 've gone from paying half fare to full fare . it 's caused mayhem . ' he added : ` equality for women : a few people battled away to get it , they got it , and they have buggered up the game for a lot of people . ' but sam burton , finance director at the ladies ' golf union , said there has only been a decline of 30,000 women since the law came into force , taking membership down to 159,000 by last year . mrs burton said : ` it 's not good that ladies golf is declining and we have to look at it , but i do n't think it 's the equalities legislation that is to blame . golf has been dominated by men and we are always going to be the minority in any club that is mixed . but on the whole golf is becoming much more equal .

' what are his attributes ? as displayed by his goal , walker is two-footed and possesses good balance . he is quick , an intelligent runner , and a smart finisher . he also has a striker 's mentality . as part of the fa youth cup hat-trick he won an argument with team-mate gerry mcdonagh over who would take a penalty , going on to score . the youngest is highly thought of by forest boss dougie freedman , who believes he has a big future .",

'' `` god no , '' they said . `` we can come here and do what we like , we can play golf and do n't pay anything '' .

' `` you 're living in the past ! you 're one of the old colonel blimp school : must wear a tie to go and have a pee in the clubhouse . '' that sort of thing .

' the broadcaster insisted he could not work for sky . he said that he could not imagine working for sky . ` they never asked me . i was a bbc man through-and-through and they paid me well enough , ' he said . ' i think sky is magnificent and if you like golf it 's amazing , but they do it differently . the presenters look different . if i went to sky the best i could do is sit in the studio or have a pre-tournament ramble about the players . ' alliss added : ' i was watching golf from dubai a couple of weeks ago . it is a masterpiece , one of the modern seven wonders of the world . every skyscraper is different . and in the middle of the desert they have created a golfing oasis . ` not once in over four hours did the commentator say , ` what an amazing place this is ' . you hoped the camera would pan round , lift up from the course . i would have said something daft like , ` if you 've got very good eyesight , you might just see lawrence of arabia over that hill ' . ' he said that he had ` thought about leaving ' the bbc . ` i 've got problems getting about but the brain is still sharp enough , ' he added . ` when i do n't think it 's sharp enough , i shall say i 'm off . the bbc keep saying to me , ` stay as long as you like .

' the club have lost on average just over # 5m per year over the past four years , more than doubling its debt burden in that period . annual accounts for 2013-14 show the club 's parent company carry no legal obligation to service the debt , meaning they could technically walk away at any time and leave the club insolvent . of most interest to their premiership rivals will be the dramatic hike in salaries paid to employees , which rose from just over # 8.1 m to more than # 9.1 m last year . the mail on sunday can reveal saracens ' mounting debt has topped # 40m -- the most in rugby history . the club took on 24 new staff in that time , nine of them players and coaches , but with the salary cap set at just # 4.5 m last season -- not allowing for one ` marquee player ' who theoretically could earn an unlimited salary but in reality will not get more than # 500,000 -- questions persist over the club 's salary structure . even allowing for the unlikely scenario of a # 1m budget for coaching staff , that would leave more than # 3m in staff costs for 54 administrative staff -- an average salary of more than # 55,000 . a premier rugby spokesman said : ` saracens have recently moved into a new purpose-built stadium , allianz park -- which is a huge asset to the local community -- with a number of new staff added . ` the club are in an investment phase and , given the strength of the shareholding base , this is something they can manage .

' more than a few of the fans lugging around similar equipment were , like watson -- who made the two-hour drive from macon -- experiencing augusta national in person for the first time . most just planned to mosey around until something caught their fancy . some had general targets in mind -- a favorite player or two , the trio of back-nine holes reverentially dubbed ` amen corner , ' or the gigantic manual scoreboard alongside the first fairway . then there was the occasional experienced big-game hunter , decked out with camera bags and an array of lenses . ` i 'm after phil mickelson , ' said kim mcneeley of nearby aiken , south carolina .

' i had to borrow this from a friend who just had a baby . a few minutes ago , i saw a guy actually loading film into his camera . film . now that 's old school . ' stepping back in time produced more than a few comical moments . parked in lawn chairs behind the first tee , two pals leaned in close as one tried to figure out how to take a ` selfie ' with a point-and-shoot camera -- never mind that the term had n't even been coined when the camera was originally manufactured . behind the seventh tee , kevin davis of gibson city , illinois , recounted the preparations he went through to make sure his 4-year-old digital camera was ready to roll . first , he had to find it -- ` it took me awhile to remember where i left it , ' he said , finally remembering it was in a desk drawer -- and then make sure it was charged . ` i 've got a big camera , but i did n't want to lug that around , ' davis added . ` that 's usually for family events . ' fans photograph tiger woods on their cell phones during a practice round for the world golf championships-bridgestone invitational at firestone country club south course in akron , ohio , last july . but he might have had second thoughts when his twin 5-year-olds saw the camera and realized it was n't a phone . ` they were scratching their heads , ' he recalled . ` they said , ` daddy , why is it so big ? '' the fact that so many wound up opting for the big camera likely had to do with the number of serious hobbyists . while many planned to share their photos with friends on social media , a few planned to commemorate the trip with a photo album -- talk about old-school -- and in the case of wes rackley , make quality 8x10 framed prints and give them as presents . few people , though , seemed as comfortable carrying around all the serious gear as brett pavel of atlanta . he was at augusta national for the 20th time -- ' i think that 's right , ' he said , ` because i 've got at least 18 shirts -- and said he has a camera around his neck at least once a week . ` my wife calls it my `` pacifier , '' ' he laughed , ` because our youngest son plays competitive soccer and she says taking pictures is the only thing that keeps me from cussing and yelling at the refs and everybody else .

    "article": "frustration was clear in the voices of peter moores and alastair cook as they fended off repeated enquiries about kevin pietersen 's future more than a year after he had seemingly been banished from international cricket for good . well , there is only one person to blame -- and that is colin graves . the incoming ecb chairman has been responsible for the mixed messages that leave the england team in as big a state of turmoil and internal rebellion as ever . graves has forged an excellent reputation in english cricket as chairman of yorkshire for the way he bankrolled and transformed the club , but his initial forays into the international game have been little short of an embarrassment . colin graves has made a habit of talking before thinking since being announced as ecb chairman . he has become the loose cannon of english cricket -- and he has yet to take up office . it all started on march 1 when he gave an interview to garry richardson of the bbc , who is known for his persistence and admirable success in coaxing ear-catching sound bites from interviewees . so when graves said that pietersen -- exiled for valid reasons after the last ashes debacle before producing a nasty autobiography that only supported the ecb 's decision -- had to be playing county cricket to earn an england recall , it was put down to yorkshire straight-talking . yet subsequently , most importantly in a phone conversation with pietersen , graves has done little to play down the 34-year-old 's chances -- even if privately the chairman is said to be perplexed at the media 's ` spin ' on his apparent opening of the england door . if graves , who has apparently assured senior figures that he does not want pietersen back , really had no intention of encouraging the maverick , then he has made a right old mess of it . for he has created a soap opera that will run and run now pietersen has rejoined surrey and put huge pressure on a fledgling england middle order who made significant test progress last summer . england head coach peter moores -lrb- left -rrb- and alastair cook answer questions at a press conference . not to mention completely undermining managing director paul downton and national selector james whitaker , who have repeatedly clarified england 's stance on the batsman over the last 14 months . and if graves disagreed with the original decision to axe pietersen , then he had a duty as deputy chairman of the ecb to say so then , not wait until he had taken over from giles clarke . that is not all . since his pietersen outburst , graves has said that there will be an inquiry if england do not beat a ` mediocre ' west indies in the upcoming three-test series . this prompted the respected barbadian commentator tony cozier to liken the comments to tony greig 's infamous intention in 1976 to make the west indies ` grovel ' . then graves came out with the ridiculous notion of reducing test matches to four days . this would be achieved by introducing the unrealistic target of playing 105 overs a day -- a move that would destroy the primacy of the ultimate game . former england batsman kevin pietersen has been linked with a return to the national side recently . if graves wants to make himself useful , then he should concentrate on his supposed main aim of introducing a 10-team english premier league franchise twenty20 competition . everybody bar a few myopic counties wants that . he could also do something about a crippling fixture list that will see england play 17 tests in the next 10 months -- a key factor in why they have fallen so far behind in the 50-over game and just endured the worst world cup in their history . there is much for the ecb 's new regime -- which includes new chief executive tom harrison and communications director chris haynes -- to do , but all the new chairman has done so far is make things worse . colin graves should think very carefully in future before he speaks .",

' bosch also executed a try-saving tackle on racing wing juan imhoff when all his argentina team-mate had to do was fall over the line for a potentially decisive final-quarter try . ` juan is a real player . he 's like a striker - always smelling the goal . i followed him and fortunately stopped him from scoring at the end , ' bosch said . until bosch delivered the knockout blow - referee nigel owens awarded the penalty with 10 seconds left on the clock - a full blooded quarter-final that was often a poor spectacle appeared to be destined for a home win . saracens fly-half charlie hodgson kicked one penalty and full-back alex goode supplied six points to keep the match favourites in sight . two second-half penalties from scrum-half maxime machenaud , who also crossed for the game 's solitary try in the 27th minute , placed racing in control that the parisians only relinquished as owens was preparing to blow for full time .

'' ` listen lads , ' he said . ` basically you 're s *** . try and enjoy the game . you 're probably going to get beat . but just enjoy being s *** . '' ` then he just walked out . those words have got to be insulting to any professional , no matter who they come from , and i 'll admit it served as the perfect motivation to get out there and prove him wrong . i scored after 10 minutes and we were leading at half-time . we ended up drawing .

'' i thought , well , that 's not so bad . `` i do n't f ****** want that . i want you to tell some of them they 're being c **** . tell them . '' ' despite a 2-0 loss away at bolton in the season 's penultimate game , sunderland secured their premier league safety with a match to spare . but although he had helped ensure another year in england 's top-flight , keane was in no mood to praise his players after their defeat against gary megson 's side . higginbotham -lrb- left -rrb- now works as a pundit after hanging up his boots in january , 2014 . reliving his manager 's post-match team talk , higginbotham writes : '' ` you 're the reason i 'm driving up and down the f ****** country to find another player , you 're not f ****** good enough , '' he yells at one player . ' `` your attitude is s *** . you 're not good enough , '' he bawls at others . ' `` next week we 've got our last home game , against arsenal . you know at the end of the season when you walk around the pitch , thank the fans for their support ? i 'm ringing umbro and getting you some hooded jumpers , because you 're a f ****** embarrassment , it 's a joke and this is not going to stay this way .

' mcilroy held a four-shot lead going into the final round four years ago , only to collapse to a closing 80 and finish 10 shots behind the winner charl schwartzel . but he bounced back to win his first major title by eight shots in the us open two months later , before adding wins in the 2012 us pga and both the open and us pga last year . mcilroy is hoping to emulate the likes of jack nicklaus -lrb- above -rrb- by winning all four major titles . ' i think it was the most important day of my career , ' he added . ` if i had n't had the whole unravelling and say i just made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch and lost by one , i might not have learnt as much . ` but for it all to come apart how it did i learnt an awful lot . i learnt so much about myself and my game and what i needed to do differently the next time i was in that position . ` luckily it did n't take me long to get into a position like that again where i was leading a major and we know how that one played out . i was able to get over the line pretty comfortably . ' mcilroy 's extraordinary success last year came despite the distractions of calling off his wedding to caroline wozniacki and a legal dispute with his former management company which cost him millions of pounds when it was finally settled in february . mcilroy 's extraordinary success last year came he called off his wedding to caroline wozniacki . and he hopes he can again use the golf course as his ` sanctuary ' from the pressure and hype surrounding augusta . ` the golf course was my sanctuary , it was where i could get away from everything and just not have to think about it for the four or five hours that i am out there and it helped . it really did , ' he added . ' i was looking forward to getting to the course and playing and practising and i think it will be the same at augusta because there will be so much hype and build up and talk about what could happen . ' i know i wo n't be able to wait until thursday morning or afternoon and just get on the golf course and play golf . there is only so much you can talk about it and then you have to go out and try and play .

'' football is an enormous pleasure for him . ' that hunger earned him two # 30million moves , first to barcelona in 2011 and then to arsenal last summer . it is also why sanchez , arsenal 's stand-out player this season , found it so difficult when he was rested for two games by arsene wenger -- against aston villa and tottenham -- with a sore hamstring . sanchez spent five years with serie a side udinese before earning a move to spanish giants barcelona . sanchez takes on defender miranda during chile 's friendly with brazil at the emirates stadium last week . ` putting him on the bench is like taking a toy from a child , ' marino warned . ` there was just one thing that worried me when he joined barcelona -- they were full of amazing forwards and it was by no means a given that alexis would be in the starting 11 . ` since i know how important it is for him to play , i feared that without regular football he could become discouraged . but he proved he was good enough to become an essential part of the team and fitted into the barca way of playing .

' a ba spokeswoman refused to discuss details of health checks carried out on pilots . the cpni has identified a number of motives for employees becoming an insider threat , including theft , revenge , a hunger for notoriety , political or religious ideology and fear or coercion , where external pressure is exerted on a worker . rescue workers and investigators work near debris at the crash site of the germanwings airbus a320 . a cpni study showed that three-quarters of insider acts were carried out by employees who had no malicious intent when joining the organisation , but whose loyalties changed after recruitment . disturbingly , it also found that in many circumstances the workers had been in their organisation for some years before going rogue . some of the more common insider acts include unauthorised disclosure of information -- such as in the case of us whistleblower edward snowden -- process corruption -lrb- where an employee illegitimately alters an internal process for their own ends -rrb- and corporate espionage . the security source said : ` years ago , the emphasis was on external security . now `` the insider '' is the growing threat , as seen in the cases of edward snowden and lubitz . ` we advise companies to look closely at their personnel . the higher security clearance they gain over their time of employment , the closer they should be monitored .

' bath stayed true to the ball-in-hand attacking principles that have lit up much of this season 's premiership campaign , and at times , leinster struggled to cope . ian madigan was perfect from the tee to hand leinster the victory in a game where they were second best . in madigan , though , they had a relentless marksman , whose 100 per cent goalkicking return ultimately sent leinster marching on and bath left to focus solely on domestic matters . ` to put on an attacking performance and go through the phases like we did against a quality side like leinster is just going to add more confidence , ' watson added . ' i think the way we have been playing this year has been a revelation to be a part of , and i have really enjoyed playing for this club . ' i think the progress we have made throughout the year has been awesome . i think the ethos and everything we are building at the club is going in the right direction . ' watson , meanwhile , paid tribute to his bath and england team-mate ford , who scored a brilliant solo try and made a darting break that set up hooper for a second-half touchdown that meant the visitors were always in sight of their opponents on the scoreboard . it was a huge disappointment for bath , but watson hopes they can channel the pain to their league campaign . ' i can not speak highly enough of him -lrb- ford -rrb- , to be honest , ' watson said . ` he is probably the best ball player i 've played with , albeit in a short space of time of two or three years . ` he has got a very mature head on young shoulders , and it 's a real privilege to play outside him . ' bath head coach mike ford could not mask his disappointment with the result , believing his team paid the price for an opening 40 minutes when they struggled for fluency and kept giving madigan scoring chances . ` there is a lot of disappointment , ' ford said . ` the first-half performance , especially , we are a lot better than that . ` that last 10-15 minutes , i was pretty convinced we were going to win the game , but it 's small margins . george ford scored one try and created anotehr in a superb performance , but it was n't enough . ` at half-time , we talked about composure . ` we had n't been able to build any pressure with ball in hand , and there was also the discipline side of things . madigan was pretty dead-eye , which cost us . ` we put it together second-half , and i think this will make us stronger . we will look back at the end of the season at this game , particularly , and say this is where bath became very strong . ' i thought anthony watson was on fire at full-back , and george made two good breaks for our tries . it was in our control , we thought . even at 15-5 down , we were confident we could win the game . ' and bath skipper hooper said : ` when you get to this stage of the competition , it is about winning . ` the disappointment is two-fold . one is obviously losing the game and the other is probably the individual mistakes we made , particularly in the first half .

    "article": "christian benteke faces a substantial pay cut if his goals are not enough to keep aston villa in the premier league -- but is set to attract interest should he continue his scoring streak . whatever villa 's premier league status this summer , benteke 's future will be discussed as his contract , worth # 50,000 per week , enters its final two years and the belgian striker has ambitions to play european football . wolfsburg have kept tabs on benteke since before he ruptured his achilles 12 months ago and remain on the lookout for a striker . the wealthy german club , currently second in bundesliga , should have funds available from champions league money , even after their # 42million splurge on chelsea duo kevin de bruyne and andre schurrle . christian benteke celebrates his opening goal against qpr at villa park on tuesday . villa value their top scorer at # 25million however , and even then would remain hugely reluctant to sell with manager tim sherwood a big fan . randy lerner is set to offload the club come the closed season and new owners will have their own thoughts . a hat-trick by benteke in the 3-3 draw with queens park rangers , capped by a brilliant free-kick , underlined his return to form under sherwood . he has scored seven goals in his last five villa games , earning the team an additional three points in the process -- the current gap to the drop zone . benteke went on to net a hat-trick which salvaged a vital point for his side . but should villa slip below the dreaded dotted line and out of the premier league , benteke is in line for an approximate 30 per cent reduction on his wages to # 35,000 a week . the 24-year-old would look to leave villa park in that scenario , rather than play in the championship , with a host of clubs likely to express interest . there is , however , no relegation release clause . even if villa stay in the premier league benteke will assess his options . two years ago he handed in a transfer request to try to force a move to tottenham hotspur following his debut season in england yielding 23 goals . the arrival of tim sherwood at villa park has rejuvenated benteke 's form in front of goal this season . he signed a new four-year deal on vastly improved terms . last season was less successful , bringing 11 goals before serious injury struck last april ruling benteke out of the world cup . his form suffered on return to the side last october , and at times he cut a bereft figure starved of service under paul lambert 's regime . lambert even dropped benteke in his penultimate game in charge at home to chelsea . sherwood 's arrival has seen benteke return to his best , with a goal every 87 minutes . that kind of strike rate should keep villa up , but also alert top-flight clubs . spurs are looking to sign young players around the # 15million mark , though , while liverpool would need to shift mario balotelli . jack grealish is convinced benteke 's goals will ensure villa 's premier league survival this season . benteke is comfortable with life in birmingham and at villa , but holds desires to play higher up the league and in continental competitions . qualification for the europa league is still a possibility through the fa cup for villa , of course . teenage winger jack grealish , who started his first premier league match against qpr , is adamant benteke will help keep villa safe . ` yes , when you have christian in the team who can score goals every game , ' he said . ` we are going to go in saturday 's game -lrb- at spurs -rrb- positive . 100 per cent we will stay up .

' quite how much the england attack got out of their morning work-out was questionable because this was a shockingly indisciplined batting display from a st kitts side who included just seven players with first-class experience . jimmy anderson and stuart broad eased their way back after their own humbling world cups but the most penetrative bowling came from stokes , who swung the ball consistently on a typically slow and flat warner park pitch . england batsmen cook plays to the leg side during the west indies tour match against st kitts and nevis xi . trott plays to the offside to reach his fifty during the st kitts and nevis invitational xi england tour match . england plan to use stokes , who was left out of the world cup after a dreadful run , as their all-rounder in this series , batting at six at least until the return of moeen ali which they hope will come ahead of the second test . stokes and chris jordan are clearly ahead of liam plunkett and the newcomer mark wood in the pecking order while adil rashid and james tredwell appear to be competing for the solitary spinner 's place next week . both took a wicket towards the end of the st kitts innings while tredwell added a spectacular one-handed slip catch . cook plays to the offside as wicketkeeper jaison peters of st kitts and nevis invitational xi looks on . cook plays to mid off as wicketkeeper peters looks on during the england tour match .",

' watford 's 18-goal striker odion ighalo intends to have a say in what happens next . ighalo helped granada reach la liga in 2011 and admits he only signed for watford to play in the english top flight . odion ighalo rescued a point for watford with this equaliser against fellow promotion hopefuls derby . bournemouth have been this season 's surprise package and led the championship for 101 days .

' sportsmail understands mackay was close to suffering the sack in february but victory at reading granted him a stay of execution . wigan were content with keeping him until at least the end of the season and kept faith with the divisive figure . sources at the dw stadium also indicated that mackay was ready to build a similar recruitment structure to that at cardiff and had been sanctioned to do so . he remained defiant they could stay in the division immediately after losing against derby . ` it 's still mathematically possible , ' he said . ` it 's fine lines between winning and losing in this league . ' wigan chairman david sharpe has said that it was a ` very difficult ' decision to sack mackay on monday .",

' casey celebrates while watching a replay of his hole-in-one , which helped europe to victory in 2006 . casey last played in the ryder cup competition in the 2008 defeat by usa at valhalla . casey played in the record ryder cup wins in 2004 and 2006 and the 2008 defeat at valhalla , but was in tears after being overlooked for a wild card by captain colin montgomerie in 2010 , when he was ranked seventh in the world . ' i desperately want to be part of a ryder cup again . there is definitely passion and a fire there burning , ' he added . ` certainly one of them i felt like i was maybe denied , the others i have n't been in a position to make the team and watching medinah and gleneagles has been brilliant . ` what they have done has been absolutely phenomenal and i want to be part of that again and not just part of it , but a real solid team player and leader in the team room , which i know i can be . when i play my best golf i think i can certainly play that kind of role . ' european captain darren clarke said earlier this week he wanted casey on his team for hazeltine next year , and the 37-year-old added : ` paul -lrb- mcginley -rrb- said the same thing -lrb- even though i was a member of the tour at the time -rrb- . ` he was desperate for me to be part of that because i had won twice around gleneagles and unfortunately was n't playing the golf i needed to .

' i was on the same flight as padraig harrington -lrb- who was also ineligible last year -rrb- on sunday and when we landed the girls who run the courtesy car service here had all made little signs saying ` welcome back padraig ' . we touched on that subject and said that we were both going to give it a good go , but enjoy it .

' mercedes chief toto wolff claims the champions will just keep calm and carry on . mercedes will look into reasons why the team was beaten into second and third in malaysia . wolff insists his team has left no stone unturned since the race in malaysia in a bid to uncover what went wrong , even though most teams would jump through hoops for a two-three finish . ` although we had two cars on the podium , we have been looking very carefully at every area where we could have performed better , ' said wolff . ` our opposition has raised its game and we must now raise ours even further . ` as we have said since melbourne , we expect a season-long battle for both world championships and we must maximise every opportunity . rosberg -lrb- left -rrb- and hamilton visited mercedes ' brackley base to go through their cars on thursday . ` china is the next chance to do that - a circuit which has been a good hunting ground for the team . ` lewis has a great record here , and for nico it 's where he made his first step into the winners ' circle . ` we have the weapons at our disposal and we need to make the most of them this weekend . ' hamilton is a three-time winner at the shanghai international circuit - including last year - whilst he has been on the podium on three other occasions . rosberg , meanwhile , was second to hamilton last year after triumphing in 2012 . like wolff , hamilton knows more can and will be done , as he said : ` malaysia was a tough weekend . hamilton heads to shanghai having won the chinese grand prix last year on his way to the title . ` it always is with the heat , but with car problems on friday , rain during qualifying on saturday and a race which did n't go to plan on sunday , that one was particularly challenging . ` ultimately we made the best choices we could , but there is always room for improvement and we 've been working hard to analyse everything for the next race in china . ` the circuit is one i really enjoy and it suits my driving style quite well . ' i won the race last year and have only finished outside of the podium places twice , so the target is definitely to build on that and get back to the front . ' the british driver is congratulated by film star arnold schwarzenegger after winning the australian grand prix . from his perspective , rosberg is far from happy with his two races to date which have seen him finish second and third . ` it 's not been a perfect start to my sixth year with the team and i 'm determined to turn that around this weekend , ' insisted rosberg . ` of course , my team-mate will have other ideas , so will my compatriot in the red car -lrb- vettel -rrb- i 'm sure . ` but this is a track that has always suited me well , so i 'm aiming to put in a strong weekend .

' vaughan has previously concentrated on his media duties but is believed to be open to the role . the former england captain speaks with stuart broad during last summer 's test series with india . vaughan holds the urn after england famously reclaimed the ashes against australia in 2005 . pietersen may not have played international cricket for well over a year but his shadow looms large over the current turmoil surrounding england . downton 's troubled reign was defined by the decision to martyr pietersen after the 2013/14 ashes . the ecb board met at lord 's on thursday , but there was no official word on the recruitment process . instead a short statement merely confirmed that giles clarke 's move from chairman to president had been rubber-stamped , with middlesex deputy chairman ian lovett nominated as vice-chairman . clarke will become the first ecb president on may 14 , a role that carries responsibility for icc business , while his old post will go to colin graves . graves was the man who gave new legs to pietersen 's mooted comeback when he appeared to suggest a blank slate policy would take root when he arrived at lord 's . graves hinted that a prolific run in county cricket could see him reinstated , which led to the 34-year-old extricating himself from his indian premier league contract and re-signing with surrey . downton 's exit removed one significant obstacle and should vaughan be handed the new position , that would strengthen his hand yet further . former director of england cricket , paul downton , was sacked after the nation 's dismal world cup . another former england captain alex stewart has also put his hat into the ring for the vacancy . surrey chief alec stewart , another former england captain who has indicated he would be open to talks with the ecb , is a confirmed pietersen supporter - but another possible applicant , andrew strauss , is unlikely to be as effusive . strauss ' relations with pietersen deteriorated badly in his final days as england captain , and an x-rated slip of the tongue during a commentary stint last summer suggested those wounds have not healed . there was no news from the board meeting on the future of national selector james whitaker , who appeared vulnerable after downton 's dismissal . he looks set to continue in the role for the time being and is due to join the senior side in the west indies for the second test in grenada and third in barbados .",

' hibs defender jordon forster admitted he 'd been motivated by a desire to silence the gloating hearts fans , saying : ` as much as you try and block out what the hearts fans are planning , you see it on social media and in the papers . you know the fans are doing this and that . ` you 'd be lying if you said you do n't hear the fans during the game . i like a bit of banter because it 's the fans ' day as well as the players . you can use it to your motivation , as long as you do n't let it affect your game in a negative way . ` it 's all a bit of fun . they have won the league - but we get the bragging rights for today . the hibernian fans were in good spirits at full-time after getting one over their city rivals . ` it 's probably the most important derby win i 've been involved in . my debut was special and i 'll always remember it but it was vital to get three points and keep the pressure on rangers . ` all we can do is keep winning games until the end of the season and see where it takes us . they -lrb- rangers -rrb- go to tynecastle at the end of the season and if we win all our games we need them to drop points somewhere . if we stay focused it could be a really good season for the club and the fans .

' . ` so it 's frustrating that people keep talking about that , because if you 're taking wickets , why does it matter if you 're bowling 87 or 93 miles an hour . finn celebrates a wicket during england 's world cup win over scotland back in february . finn , seen after taking five wickets in england 's world cup warm-up over india , was a high point of the tour . ` what does it matter ? you 're taking wickets . ` so that to me is baffling and it 's silly to me , i find it stupid , but each to their own . ` yes there might be a couple of extra miles an hour in there , as i 've always been searching for . ` ever since i was 20 and came into international cricket i 've always been looking at how i am going to get better and make myself a member of the england team who is hard to be left out . ` and that 's what i 'm working back towards , and i certainly feel i 'm on the way .

' city have held the edge over united in recent contests and could register a fifth successive derby win for the first time in their history with victory this weekend . a win would also see them become the first club to beat united five times in a row in the premier league . united had the last laugh over city after the first of their current sequence of derby wins by winning the league in 2013 but since then the blues have had the bragging rights . pellegrini said : ' i think that they have a lot of respect for our team because last year it was the team that dominated not only the derby but i think we dominated also the premier league . it is not easy for a team . ` in the last three years we won two and in the other we were runner-up . this year we have been runner-up the whole year . ` we have to play seven games more and we will see what happens at the end of the season and in which position we will stay , but i think for them , they must try to beat the team that has been better in the last few years . ' city are likely to come up against an altogether different opponent than the crystal palace side that frustrated them last monday . louis van gaal 's united have been fluid of late , winning impressively against tottenham , liverpool and aston villa to take their run of victories to five . facing a side that is not inclined to sit back could suit city but pellegrini is dismissive of suggestions that might make it easier than in their most recent away losses at palace and burnley . the chilean said : ` you never know but i do n't think it will be easy . it will be different . ` united are a big team that like to play - especially with van gaal . he 's always an attacking manager . we hope we will see a good game . ` we have a different problem , we have to make sure we do n't make mistakes because they have important and technically very good players .

    "article": "there was poetic symmetry in glenn murray 's humbling of vincent kompany at selhurst park on monday night . ten years ago this month , the crystal palace striker humiliated another of the world 's best defenders , world cup and champions league winner gerard pique . sure , pique was just 18 at the time and playing for manchester united 's reserves but he , like kompany , is all too aware of murray 's talents after the cumbrian scored a hat-trick against him in carlisle colours . glenn murray jumps for joy after putting crystal palace 1-0 up against manchester city on monday night . barcelona and spain defender gerard pique once conceded three against murray in a reserve match in 2005 . their careers have taken wholly different paths in the last decade but after a man-of-the-match display which all but ended the premier league champions ' title defence in a match viewed by millions around the world , murray now gets a little taste of the limelight that pique has basked in at barcelona for years . his poachers ' effort on monday was his fifth goal in his last five games . murray now boasts the fifth-best goals-per-minute ratio in europe 's top five leagues . he may lack pace but murray 's speed of thought is rapid and you will struggle to find a frontman in the land with a better ability to win the ball in the air , bring others in to play and generally unsettle defenders . just look at how troubled the vastly experienced and physically powerfully manchester city pair of kompany and martin demichelis were on monday night . much of murray 's success comes from his cunning , a nous to win duels and subtly influence referees no doubt enhanced by years playing at the lower levels . murray holds off a challenge from manchester city captain vincent kompany . kompany looks inconsolable at the end of the game after manchester city were beaten 2-1 . and we 're not just talking leagues one and two here , where murray first began to shine with rochdale and brighton . before then he had turned out in non-league for workington , barrow , carlisle and even had a spell at wilmington hammerheads in america 's third tier . footballers just do n't take that sort of path to the top anymore , but there is no doubt murray , now 31 , deserves his chance . his telepathic understanding with flying wingers wilfried zaha and yannick bolasie brought him 30 goals in 2012-13 and with it crystal palace 's promotion . cruelly , he ruptured his cruciate knee ligament in the play-off semi-final victory over brighton that year and missed the majority of last season recovering . he had notched up 14 appearances by the end of the campaign , mostly off the bench , but looked a shadow of his former self under tony pulis , with the exception of a typically bullying display in liverpool 's famous implosion at selhurst last may . murray celebrates scoring at old trafford as palace beat manchester united in december 2011 . murray scores against manchester city for brighton in the league cup back in september 2008 . despite his rugged style murray , like most players , needs a proverbial arm around the shoulder to produce his best - something alan pardew has undoubtedly afforded him and that neil warnock before him emphatically failed to do . pardew 's predecessor shipped murray out on loan to reading to make room in his squad for kevin doyle , a striker who had scored just three goals in 23 games in league one for wolves the season before . how foolish that move looks now . pardew , in contrast , immediately reinstalled murray in the palace side and gave him a new contract to the end of next season when he took over in january . his faith has been rewarded with a rich vein of goalscoring form that gives murray the best goals-per-minute ratio of anyone in the premier league . murray wheels away to celebrate as city 's defenders appeal in vain for offside . the cumbrian striker signed a new contract for crystal palace back in january . only four players in europe have a better ratio than murray -- though he has some way to go to catch cristiano ronaldo and lionel messi . one thing is for sure though , kompany will certainly be glad to see the back of him , as was pique 10 years ago .",

    "article": "manchester united manager louis van gaal has praised the resurrection of marouane fellaini as the big belgian prepares to play in the fixture that marked the low point of his old trafford career 12 months ago . on march 25 last year , fellaini was jeered by both city and united fans as he was substituted in a 3-0 united defeat that proved the deathknell to the manager who signed him , david moyes . even more hurtfully , reds legend paul scholes was scathing about fellaini 's united career up that point , saying on television : ` i 'd be expecting a lot more of him .

' fellaini , who cost # 27million when moyes signed him from everton , has scored three goals in united 's revival and also scored three times for his country in their two recent euro 2016 qualifiers . as importantly , his aerial presence in both penalty areas has helped united . his overall physicality has helped lvg bring back a formation that he used earlier in the season against chelsea , manchester city and west brom , without winning any of them . this season though , van gaal has been impressed with the midfielder 's -lrb- right -rrb- ability in defence and attack . ` we have n't got the tallest team and have problems with the long ball , ' admitted van gaal . ` so we press more than we used to . we have changed our shape to 4-3-3 because you can press better , i tried it at that time but we could n't do it . it 's a process and now we can do it . ' typically for van gaal though , there was a sting in the tail in case fellaini should start to believe the good publicity . ' i took him off against villa in the last game , that was n't for no reason , ' stressed the manager . van gaal also had praise for spanish goalkeeper david de gea who is interesting real madrid . the united boss has until now been reserved in his praise for de gea but he went on a charm offensive yesterday after the keeper made a rare mistake to allow aston villa 's christian benteke to score last weekend . ` de gea has had a marvellous season and everybody knows that . he was very important in a lot of matches and therefore i ca n't change him , ' said van gaal . fellaini -lrb- right -rrb- has proved a more effective no 10 than club record signing angel di maria this season .",

' spanish full-back bellerin scored his second arsenal goal against liverpool , on saturday , a wonderful curling left-footer to break the deadlock and launch his team towards a 4-1 win . he was also responsible for keeping raheem sterling under control when daniel sturridge came off the bench at half-time and liverpool reshuffled . ` he played against a great player in sterling , ' said wenger . ` i selected him because of his pace . i thought sturridge would play and sterling would be on the flank . and because of his low centre of gravity . sterling changes direction very quickly and hector is a short as well . hector bellerin celebrates scoring arsenal 's first goal during the 4-1 victory against liverpool . bellerin broke the emirates deadlock for arsenal , cutting in and curling a left-foot strike into the corner . arsene wenger admits he did n't expect bellerin and coquelin to be playing such key roles . ` maybe he still has some experience to gain but his defending one-against-one is good and going forward he is good . he scored an important goal in a big game and that always shows that the guy has the mental quality to be there . ' the arsenal boss did admit bellerin might have been lucky not to be sent off , having been already booked when he mistimed a slide tackle on sterling and conceded a penalty , scored by jordan henderson . ` he was a bit lucky there , ' said wenger . ` he could have got one but i think he genuinely went for the ball . i was just thinking : what do i do if he gets a second yellow ? in the end the referee decided not to give him a yellow because he went for the ball . he was unlucky for the first yellow . ' nacho monreal and oliver giroud are among the first to congratulate the unlikely opening goalscorer . wenger revealed had all but given up on coquelin when he was sent on loan to charlton before christmas .",

' given the general disappointments of last summer 's principle signings - fernando , bacary sagna and eliaquim mangala - pellegrini 's words could be perceived as a plea for more cash . but when pushed further , pellegrini , perhaps not surprisingly given that his own position could be uncertain , would not say whether a spending spree might be sanctioned . pellegrini still believes his manchester city side are capable of retaining the premier legaue title . he said : ' i do n't want to talk about -lrb- plans -rrb- for next season because we have to finish this season . it is very important the way we finish this season before we analyse all the players . so it is not the right moment to talk about it . ' pellegrini 's immediate concern is his side 's league position . results elsewhere have seen city drop two places over the weekend and , although pellegrini has not given up on the title , he clearly can not even take the runners-up spot for granted . he said : ` well we are not thinking about just one team . i think it is important for our team to finish at the top of the table but if we ca n't win the premier league then we must try to be second . ` but it is important to play from now until the end of the season in a way that shows you are an important team and are prepared to fight until the last game to try and retain the title .
