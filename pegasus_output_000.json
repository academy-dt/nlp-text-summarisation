    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- the palestinian authority officially became the 123rd member of the international criminal court on wednesday , a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in palestinian territories . the formal accession was marked with a ceremony at the hague , in the netherlands , where the court is based . the palestinians signed the icc 's founding rome statute in january , when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed `` in the occupied palestinian territory , including east jerusalem , since june 13 , 2014 . '' later that month , the icc opened a preliminary examination into the situation in palestinian territories , paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against israelis . as members of the court , palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well . israel and the united states , neither of which is an icc member , opposed the palestinians ' efforts to join the body . but palestinian foreign minister riad al-malki , speaking at wednesday 's ceremony , said it was a move toward greater justice . `` as palestine formally becomes a state party to the rome statute today , the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice , '' he said , according to an icc news release . `` indeed , today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace . '' judge kuniko ozaki , a vice president of the icc , said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the palestinians . `` as the rome statute today enters into force for the state of palestine , palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a state party to the statute . these are substantive commitments , which can not be taken lightly , '' she said . rights group human rights watch welcomed the development . `` governments seeking to penalize palestine for joining the icc should immediately end their pressure , and countries that support universal acceptance of the court 's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership , '' said balkees jarrah , international justice counsel for the group . `` what 's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice , not palestine 's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members . '' in january , when the preliminary icc examination was opened , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu described it as an outrage , saying the court was overstepping its boundaries . the united states also said it `` strongly '' disagreed with the court 's decision . `` as we have said repeatedly , we do not believe that palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the icc , '' the state department said in a statement . it urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations . `` we will continue to oppose actions against israel at the icc as counterproductive to the cause of peace , '' it said . but the icc begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as `` palestine . '' while a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation , it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides . prosecutor fatou bensouda said her office would `` conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality . '' the war between israel and hamas militants in gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead . the inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since june . the international criminal court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes . cnn 's vasco cotovio , kareem khadder and faith karimi contributed to this report .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- on may 28 , 2014 , some 7,000 people gathered in a stadium in china 's northwestern xinjiang region . but they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event . instead , the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits . armed soldiers guarded the exits . in the patently unfair , open air trial that followed , 55 people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed . three were sentenced to death . the public mass sentencing was part a china 's `` strike hard '' campaign against unrest in xinjiang , a campaign the government claims was launched to combat `` terrorism '' and `` separatism . '' but it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided , and often cynical , attempt to tackle crime and terrorism . today , amnesty international releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide . much of it makes for grim reading . in pakistan , the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific taliban attack on a school in peshawar in december . more than 60 people have been put to death since , and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows . iran and iraq executed people for `` terrorism , '' and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes . in a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before , governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee-jerk reaction to terrorism . other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates . jordan ended an eight-year moratorium in december , putting 11 murder convicts to death , with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime . in indonesia , authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety `` national emergency . '' six people have already been executed this year . a sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool . the rise was largely because of developments in egypt and nigeria , where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict . the simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both . there is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence , as united nations and other studies have repeatedly confirmed . it is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough . at amnesty international , we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades . thankfully , most of the world now appears to agree with us . the numbers speak for themselves . in 1945 when the united nations was founded , only eight countries had abolished the death penalty . today , 140 states are abolitionist in law or practice . last year , we recorded executions in 22 countries , down by almost a half from 20 years ago . despite the troubling developments we recorded last year , there was still much good news to be found . the number of executions recorded around the world dropped significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year , from 778 to 607 . this number does not include china , where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together , but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret , the true figure is impossible to determine . executions were recorded in only three countries in sub-saharan africa -- equatorial guinea , somalia and sudan -- and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter . the americas continued to be execution-free , apart from the united states . those governments that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history . they must join the vast majority of countries which have dropped the ultimate cruel punishment . fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task , but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment . with determination , i know that we can achieve this goal .",

'' theia is only one year old but the dog 's brush with death did not leave her unscathed . she suffered a dislocated jaw , leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe . the veterinary hospital 's good samaritan fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog 's treatment , but mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog 's care . she 's also created a facebook page to keep supporters updated . donors have already surpassed the $ 10,000 target , inspired by theia 's tale of survival against the odds . on the fundraising page , mellado writes , `` she is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw . i agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home . '' she is dedicated to making sure theia gets the medical attention she needs , mellado adds , and wants to `` make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again !

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- if you 've been following the news lately , there are certain things you doubtless know about mohammad javad zarif . he is , of course , the iranian foreign minister . he has been u.s. secretary of state john kerry 's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks . and he received a hero 's welcome as he arrived in iran on a sunny friday morning . `` long live zarif , '' crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street . you may well have read that he is `` polished '' and , unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues , `` jovial . '' an internet search for `` mohammad javad zarif '' and `` jovial '' yields thousands of results . he certainly has gone a long way to bring iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community . but there are some facts about zarif that are less well-known . here are six : . in september 2013 , zarif tweeted `` happy rosh hashanah , '' referring to the jewish new year . that prompted christine pelosi , the daughter of house minority leader nancy pelosi , to respond with a tweet of her own : `` thanks . the new year would be even sweeter if you would end iran 's holocaust denial , sir . '' and , perhaps to her surprise , pelosi got a response . `` iran never denied it , '' zarif tweeted back . `` the man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone . happy new year . '' the reference was likely to former iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who had left office the previous month . zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by ahmadinejad 's successor , hassan rouhami . his foreign ministry notes , perhaps defensively , that `` due to the political and security conditions of the time , he decided to continue his education in the united states . '' that is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the shah of iran , which began in 1977 , and during the iranian revolution , which drove the shah from power in 1979 . zarif left the country in 1977 , received his undergraduate degree from san francisco state university in 1981 , his master 's in international relations from the university of denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the university of denver in 1988 . both of his children were born in the united states . the website of the iranian foreign ministry , which zarif runs , can not even agree with itself on when he was born . the first sentence of his official biography , perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in tehran , says zarif was `` born to a religious traditional family in tehran in 1959 . '' later on the same page , however , his date of birth is listed as january 8 , 1960 . and the iranian diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 . so he is 54 , 55 or maybe even 56 . whichever , he is still considerably younger than his opposite number , kerry , who is 71 . the feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the alavi foundation , a charitable organization . the u.s. justice department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the iranian government to launder money and get around u.s. sanctions . but last year , a settlement in the case , under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in manhattan along with other properties to the u.s. government , did not mention zarif 's name . early in the iranian revolution , zarif was among the students who took over the iranian consulate in san francisco . the aim , says the website iranian.com -- which cites zarif 's memoirs , titled `` mr. ambassador '' -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently islamic . later , the website says , zarif went to make a similar protest at the iranian mission to the united nations . in response , the iranian ambassador to the united nations offered him a job . in fact , he has now spent more time with kerry than any other foreign minister in the world . and that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men , with help from other foreign ministers as well , try to meet a june 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in switzerland .",

'' iran had been in the running to host the 2019 edition of soccer 's asian cup , but the tournament was awarded to the united arab emirates . the ban on women attending matches was widely seen as a major impediment to iran 's chances of securing the event . the ban came under the spotlight at the asian cup in australia earlier this year , when thousands of female iranian fans watched their soccer team without restriction . during the match against iraq , activists called for the ban to end and unfurled a banner showing the face of ghoncheh ghavami , a british-iranian woman detained in iran last year while trying to watch a volleyball match . iranian officials have denied that ghavami was arrested for attending the volleyball game , saying she was taken into custody for `` anti-iran activities .

'' `` i think there 's a third alternative , and that is standing firm , ratcheting up the pressure until you get a better deal , '' netanyahu told cnn 's jim acosta sunday on `` state of the union . '' his comments come as democrats and republicans spar over the framework announced last week to lift western sanctions on iran in exchange for the country dropping from 19,000 to 5,060 active centrifuges , limiting its highly enriched uranium , and increasing inspections . president barack obama endorsed the deal , saying it was better than the alternatives . but gop contenders for the party 's 2016 presidential nomination lambasted it , saying it gave iran too much flexibility . on sunday , the sparring continued . one senate democrat said netanyahu needs to `` contain himself . '' and a top republican said almost any of obama 's successors as president `` could do better . '' netanyahu 's most recent argument against the iran nuclear deal was similar to the one he 'd made in a march trip to washington , when he addressed a joint session of congress -- fueling a republican push to have the deal sent to congress before it 's implemented . `` it does not roll back iran 's nuclear program . it keeps a vast nuclear infrastructure in place . not a single centrifuge is destroyed . not a single nuclear facility is shut down , including the underground facilities that they built illicitly . thousands of centrifuges will keep spinning , enriching uranium , '' netanyahu said sunday . `` that 's a very bad deal . '' netanyahu said iran is a country of `` congenital cheating '' and that it ca n't be trusted to abide by the terms of the deal , which lasts 10 years with some provisions extending well beyond that . he said his opposition has little to do with his frosty relationship with obama . `` i think that we can have a legitimate difference of opinion on this , because i think iran has shown to be completely distrustful , '' netanyahu said . democratic sen. dianne feinstein of california , meanwhile , said she wishes netanyahu `` would contain himself . '' the top-ranking democrat on the senate intelligence committee said negotiators working on the deal -- from iran and the united states , as well as russia , china , britain , france and germany -- are `` on the cusp of something that can be workable . '' `` it 's a framework . it has to be wrapped into a final agreement . there still can be some changes , '' feinstein said . `` but i do n't think it 's helpful for israel to come out and oppose this one opportunity to change a major dynamic -- which is downhill , a downhill dynamic in this part of the world . '' energy secretary ernest moniz defended the deal in an appearance on cbs ' `` face the nation '' on sunday , saying it would extend from two months to one year the `` breakout '' time period -- the length of time it would take iran to build a nuclear bomb . he said it also allows for the `` almost instantaneous recognition of any attempt to evade the deal . '' `` we have blocked all of these pathways to a bomb , '' he said . sen. lindsey graham , r-south carolina , said on `` face the nation '' that the best option for the united states is to keep current sanctions in place for two more years and then have a `` new crack at it with a new president that does n't have the baggage of obama . '' and he said the alternatives to obama on both sides -- with the exception of sen. rand paul of kentucky , who 's called for a less active u.s. role overseas -- would likely strike a better deal . `` hillary clinton would do better . i think everybody on our side , except , maybe , rand paul , could do better , '' graham said .",

'' authorities say charleston parked his vehicle nearby and then popped the hood as if there were something wrong . then he walked to the cvs , preparing to enter . when agents confronted him , charleston ran , got in his car and traveled about 75 yards as agents opened fire . `` there were several fbi vehicles that were rammed or were hit by the suspect 's vehicle when he was trying to flee . one government vehicle sustained heavy damage to its front and side , and another government suv ended up on its side . that 's how the two agents sustained their injuries , '' emmett said . twelve fbi agents and six government vehicles followed charleston . emmett said charleston `` was trying to get away , our agents were trying to stop him . he collided with the first government vehicle , the taurus , then the second , and the suv ended on its side . `` the perp was stopped 8 feet away in the median , and that 's where he received his gunshot wounds . '' the two agents were treated at an area hospital and released , according to emmett , who says `` they are fine . '' charleston was shot and wounded by fbi agents and task force officers , but his injuries are not life threatening , according to forsyth county sheriff 's deputy robin regan . although he declined to give details of the 32 previous robberies , emmett said it was an intensive investigation that was already underway as a priority for the fbi 's violent crimes and major offender squad . he added , `` his mo involved armed confrontations , so our officers went into this fully prepared for an armed confrontation based on his past history . '' emmett says he 's relieved that the fbi 's officers and agents are ok and that the suspect is in custody . he said it was the `` conclusion of an intensive and lengthy investigation .

'' the lhc generates up to 600 million particles per second , with a beam circulating for 10 hours , traveling more than 6 billion miles -lrb- more than 10 billion kilometers -rrb- -- the distance from earth to neptune and back again . at near light-speed , a proton in the lhc makes 11,245 circuits per second . it took thousands of scientists , engineers and technicians decades to devise and build the particle accelerator , housed in a tunnel between lake geneva and the jura mountain range . the purpose of the lengthy project is to recreate the conditions that existed moments after the `` big bang '' -- the scientific theory said to explain the creation of the universe . by replicating the energy density and temperature , scientists hope to uncover how the universe evolved . our current , limited , knowledge is based on what 's called the standard model of particle physics . `` but we know that this model is not complete , '' dr. mike lamont , operations group leader at the lhc , told cnn in march . the burning questions that remain include the origin of mass and why some particles are very heavy , while others have no mass at all ; a unified description of all the fundamental forces such as gravity ; and uncovering dark matter and dark energy , since visible matter accounts for only 4 percent of the universe . the lhc could also question the idea that the universe is only made of matter , despite the theory that antimatter must have been produced in the same amounts at the time of the big bang . cern says the energies achievable by the lhc have only ever been found in nature . the machine alone costs approximately three billion euros -lrb- about $ 3.3 billion -rrb- , paid for by member countries of cern and contributions by non-member nations . the organization also asserts that its guidelines for the protection of the environment and personnel comply with standards set by swiss and french laws and a european council directive . scientists and physics enthusiasts will be waiting with bated breath as the lhc ventures into the great unknown . `` after two years of effort , the lhc is in great shape , '' said cern director for accelerators and technology , fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick bordry . `` but the most important step is still to come when we increase the energy of the beams to new record levels .

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- residents of central sanaa , the yemeni capital , have learned the hard way that key strategic bombing targets are located in their neighborhoods : detonating ordnance has been shattering their windows and doors . and fighting has killed hundreds of people in less than two weeks . the saudi-led coalition smashed parts of yemen 's defense ministry central command in the capital over the weekend , senior yemeni officials said . under the rain of coalition bombs , the houthis , who are shiites in a majority sunni country , still control sanaa . but the airstrikes have hurt them and destroyed a lot of infrastructure . the electricity has gone out on 16 million yemenis living in houthi-held areas , the yemeni officials said . many fear they will lose access to clean water as well . yemen 's deposed president abdu rabu mansour hadi heaped scorn on top of the airstrikes . he fired his former army chief of staff , hussein khairan , on sunday . the firing had no practical effect , since khairan had switched sides weeks ago and is the houthi rebels ' acting defense minister . hadi is holed up in saudi arabia , which is working to defeat his enemies and reinstall him . fighting has ended dozens of lives each day . on monday , more than 50 people died in the port city of aden alone , where houthis and their allies are battling troops loyal to hadi on the ground , agence france-press reported . since the bombing campaign and intense fighting began just over a week ago , some 600 people are estimated to have been killed . many more have been wounded , and tens of thousands have fled the country . the international committee of the red cross has cried out for a humanitarian ceasefire to let aid in . `` otherwise , put starkly , many more people will die . for the wounded , their chances of survival depend on action within hours , not days , '' said robert mardini , the icrc 's head of operations in the near and middle east . `` medical supplies need to be here yesterday , '' said icrc spokeswoman marie-claire feghali from sanaa . `` we need to save the lives that can be saved . '' saudi arabia signed off on letting the icrc into yemen via two aircraft -- one with medical supplies , the other with workers . but flying in will be hard , since most airlines have canceled their flights , and airstrikes have taken out many airfields . on monday , the flight loaded with 48 tons of medical supplies was grounded in djibouti , feghali said . the icrc is hoping to fly out in a day or two . following the icrc 's call , on saturday the u.n. security council discussed the humanitarian situation at russia 's behest . moscow submitted a draft resolution calling for a halt to the airstrikes by the nine-country regional coalition . the meeting adjourned with no decision announced . one diplomat said the draft was missing key elements . it did n't call for the houthis to stop fighting or for political talks between the belligerents , the diplomat told cnn on condition of anonymity . yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since houthi rebels -- who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority sunni country -- forced hadi from power . the houthis put hadi under house arrest when they overtook sanaa in january . but hadi escaped in february , fled to aden and declared himself to still be president . houthis and their allies , including those loyal to hadi 's predecessor , then fought hadi 's forces in the aden area . hadi fled aden in late march , ultimately for saudi arabia , when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city . the conflict prompted saudi arabia , a predominately sunni nation and yemen 's northern neighbor , and other arab nations to intervene with force . the houthis are allied with iran , saudi arabia 's bitter rival across the persian gulf , and riyadh does not want an proxy of iran in power on its border . complicating matters in yemen is the fact that al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -- not the houthis or the forces loyal to hadi -- holds sway in the country 's east . aqap is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization . it has taken advantage of the chaos to overrun one city and break prisoners out of jail . hadi 's government had cooperated with the united states to fight aqap , but with the houthi takeover , that arrangement has evaporated , and the terror group operates generally unchecked .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- the terrorist group al-shabaab has claimed an attack on garissa university college in eastern kenya , in which many people have been killed and still more taken hostage . the attack is another step in the ongoing escalation of the terrorist group 's activities , and a clear indicator that the security situation in east africa is deteriorating fast . somalia-based al-shabaab has been behind a string of recent attacks in kenya , the most well-known of them being the massacre at the westgate shopping centre in nairobi in 2013 . cross-border raids into kenya by the group , however , date back to 2011 . al-shabaab incursions triggered a military response by the government in nairobi , which sent troops to somalia as part of an african union mission in support of somalia 's internationally recognized government that had been under pressure from al-shabaab and other militants for several years . al-shabaab is predominantly driven by the same radical interpretation of the koran as al-qaeda and isis -lrb- also known as islamic state -rrb- , but also employs more opportunistic approaches to shoring up local support . its origins lie in al-ittihad al-islami -lrb- unity of islam -rrb- , one of several militant factions that emerged in the wake of the fall of siad barre in 1991 . these disparate groups fought each other and a u.n. peacekeeping mission in the somali civil war that led to the complete collapse of the country , from which it has yet to recover almost quarter of a century later . al-shabaab -lrb- literally `` the youth '' -rrb- split from unity of islam in 2003 and merged with another radical islamist group , the so-called islamic courts union . as their alliance obtained control of somalia 's capital mogadishu in 2006 , ethiopia , the only majority christian country in the region , took military action against the group . the offensive weakened al-shabaab and pushed it back into the rural areas of central and southern somalia , but it failed to defeat it . to the contrary , ethiopia 's invasion and occupation of parts of somalia -- although invited by the somali government and backed by the african union -- enabled al-shabaab to partially re-invent itself as both an islamist and nationalist force opposing a foreign `` christian '' invasion . initially , the group primarily attacked ethiopian forces , but soon began to `` expand '' its activities against the somali government as well . the first attack outside somalia was an attack in the ugandan capital of kampala in 2010 . soon after this , cross-border raids in kenya began , predominantly targeting christians there . increasing its links with al-qaeda , al-shabaab declared its full allegiance in 2012 -- and it is not clear whether it will switch allegiances to isis . much will depend on how the relationships between al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , a long-time ally of al-shabaab based in yemen , and isis develop . the key point is that al-shabaab 's attack in garissa is part of a broader regional context of instability fueled by a huge number of factors . it must not be interpreted simply as another act of garden-variety fundamentalist terrorism . clearly , the presence and activities of terrorist groups in the region is a major concern , and it is undoubtedly driven by radical and exclusivist interpretations of islam . but the entire region also suffers from a range of other problems : from economic development challenges to environmental degradation ; from organized crime to inter-tribal and inter-communal violence ; from corruption to serious deficits in human rights and good governance . these entrenched inequalities help al-shabaab appeal to a wide variety of potential recruits , who may sympathize with and actively support the group for any number of reasons . attacking a university in northern kenya and separating christian from muslim students epitomizes the way al-shabaab advances itself by exploiting religious , tribal and nationalist identities . ultimately , though , this all comes down to a struggle for control -- over people , over territory , and over resources . as long as the majority of people in the region remain excluded from any meaningful political , economic , and social participation in their societies -- which are dominated by primarily self-interested elites that put their own advance before that of their communities -- human lives matter little in the pursuit of selfish interests . it is important to counter al-shabaab directly , including by military means . but there wo n't be any lasting solution to the wider region 's security problems without a more comprehensive and concerted effort to address the deeper problems of exclusion suffered by the citizens of the countries challenged by al-shabaab . as garissa shows , these problems are still providing oxygen for nihilistic ideologies and their deadly fruit . copyright 2015 the conversation . some rights reserved .",

'' cassandra was diagnosed with hodgkin lymphoma in september and medical experts gave her an 85 % chance of survival if treated with chemotherapy . without it , doctors said at the time , she was likely to die within two years . she started chemotherapy in november but ran away after two days , according to court documents , when she decided she did not want to put the poison of the treatment into her body . in december , a judge ordered the young woman to be under the custody of the connecticut department of children and families . at that time , she was admitted to connecticut children 's medical center in hartford and has remained there since then . doctors surgically implanted a port in cassandra 's chest to administer chemotherapy medications , which began in spite of legal maneuvers to halt them . cassandra is feeling well and is in good shape as far as her health is concerned , according to michtom . `` she 's seen in her case the side effects were n't bad , and she 's been well-treated by the nurses and doctors and does want to complete the treatment , '' he said . her treatment is scheduled to wrap up this month . michtom and taylor failed in their effort before the connecticut supreme court to make the case that cassandra was mature enough to make her own medical decisions . joette katz , the commissioner of the department of children and families , told cnn in march the agency is `` very pleased with cassandra 's progress toward a complete recovery . we understand how difficult this has been for cassandra and her family , but we have had full confidence throughout that the medical professionals involved in her treatment would be successful in saving her life . '' the agency has denied cnn 's request to speak with cassandra or her physicians . according to michtom , the department of children and families could have withdrawn its position for an order of custody but has n't . he said the department sees cassandra as a flight risk because she has run away before . representatives for the department have said in court and in conversations with michtom and taylor that they will withdraw their pending neglect petition once cassandra completes her last round of chemo -- expected around the end of april -- and that she 'll be allowed to return home . so for now , cassandra is said to spend her days reading , watching tv and drawing . `` the hospital is effectively jail , '' michtom said .",

'' according to the asian migrant coordinating body , ningsih was visiting hong kong as a tourist and had been due to fly back to jakarta the day after her body was found . last year , her grieving father , ahmad khaliman , told agence france-presse that his daughter had worked in hong kong as a domestic helper between 2011 and 2013 . she 'd since returned on two occasions , khaliman said . he said the family had been shocked by her murder , and called for the perpetrator to be executed . `` if not , i can not accept it . he has already taken my daughter 's life , so he has to pay with his life , '' he told cnn affiliate trans7 . seneng mujiasih had more recently worked as a domestic worker in hong kong but had overstayed her visa , according to the asian migrant co-ordinating body . also known as jesse lorena , mujiasih was from the city of muna in sulawesi province , in southeast indonesia . other than that , few details are known about her life and why she stayed on in hong kong . after news of their death spread , fellow domestic workers held a vigil in hong kong 's victoria park . around 200 people gathered to sing and pray , and lay flowers besides photos of the two women . the victims ' bodies were buried after being repatriated to indonesia in november . before being taken into custody , rurik jutting lived in the upmarket j residence in wan chai . he was detained at the scene , where police found the bodies of two women and seized a knife during a search of the premises . it 's unclear when jutting left his job as a trader at the bank of america merrill lynch ; a boa spokesman would only confirm that a man of the same name had worked there in the past . jutting 's profile on linkedin said he haad been employed at the bank 's structured equity finance and trading division in hong kong since july 2013 . before that , he worked in the same unit in london for three years . according to the profile , jutting previously worked in capital markets for the british bank barclays and studied history and law at the prestigious university of cambridge , between 2004 and 2008 . as part of the trial process , tests were conducted to determined if jutting was psychologically fit to enter a plea . he was . the case was then adjourned to allow for more than 200 pieces of forensic and dna evidence to be analyzed .",

'' inoki has appeared in the u.s.-based wwe -- which describes him as `` among the most respected men in sports-entertainment '' -- and is the founder of the new japan pro wrestling organization . he entered japan 's upper house for a second stint in politics in 2013 . he also famously fought muhammad ali in 1976 , in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches , which would later pave the way for today 's wildly popular mixed martial arts contests . before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on japanese tv variety shows and has promoted a slew of products , from hot sauce to banks . the maverick politician also traveled to iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of japanese hostages , and has more recently attempted to replicate former nba star dennis rodman 's `` basketball diplomacy '' by staging a wrestling tournament in north korea . he reportedly converted to islam in the 1990s , although he says he practices both islam and buddhism . the lawmaker , who is universally known in japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements , had asked a upper house budget committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats , and if research was being done into alien visitors , prompting nakatani 's response . inoki also claims to have seen a ufo with his own eyes , but admitted that he did n't know personally if aliens existed . the exchange was n't the first time japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet . in 2007 then-defense minister shigeru ishiba pondered the legal ramifications , under japan 's pacifist constitution , of a defense against an invasion from outer space . read more : japan unveils izumo , its largest warship since world war ii .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- the fbi has confirmed that one of its most wanted terrorists , the malaysian bomb maker known as marwan , was killed in an otherwise disastrous raid in the philippines in january . marwan , whose real name is zulkifli bin hir , was believed by the fbi to a member of southeast asian terror group jemaah islamiyah 's central command . the fbi said in february that a dna sample -- understood to be from a severed finger -- taken from a man killed in a raid in the southern philippines showed a link with a known relative of marwan . but the fbi now says tests have confirmed that the dead man was the wanted islamic extremist . `` after a thorough review of forensic data and information obtained from our philippine law enforcement partners , the fbi has assessed that terrorism subject , zulkifli abdhir ... is deceased and has been removed from the fbi 's list of most wanted terrorists , '' david bowdich , assistant director in charge of the fbi 's los angeles field office , told cnn in a statement . the fbi had been offering a $ 5 million reward for information leading to marwan 's capture in the wake of his 2007 indictment on terror charges in a california court . it accused him of being a supplier of ieds to terrorist organizations , and having conducted bomb making training for terror groups , including the philippines-based abu sayyaf . marwan had previously been falsely reported dead after a raid by philippine security forces in 2012 . the philippines has been fighting an insurgency in the predominantly muslim south for years , and last year signed a peace agreement with the moro islamic liberation front -lrb- milf -rrb- , the largest rebel group in the region . but in january it launched a surprise raid in pursuit of marwan at mamapasono , in the southern province of maguindanao . the mission went disastrously awry . forty-four members of the police 's elite special action force -lrb- saf -rrb- unit were killed in the assault , targeting an area controlled by the bangsamoro islamic freedom fighters -lrb- biff -rrb- -- a hardline splinter group which has rejected the peace deal with the philippines government . according to a report released by the institute for policy analysis of conflict -lrb- ipac -rrb- last month , the biff faction sheltering marwan had sworn allegiance to isis . in the immediate aftermath of the assault , the saf company charged with executing marwan came under fire , before another saf company stationed in nearby milf territory as a `` blocking force '' became engaged in an eight-hour firefight with milf fighters . according to the ipac report , the saf `` blocking '' company eventually ran out of ammunition and only one of their number survived , . eighteen milf fighters were killed and a number of biff fighters may also died . the clash shattered a three-year ceasefire with the milf , authorities said . a national day of mourning was declared as the men were laid to rest . bowdich expressed the fbi 's `` sincere condolences to the brave officers of the special action force who lost their lives while attempting to apprehend this dangerous fugitive . '' while an saf superintendent said at a eulogy for the fallen commandos that their sacrifice had been worth it , controversy has dogged the botched mission in the philippines . the ipac report argued that the `` single-minded focus '' of authorities on killing marwan has threatened the peace agreement with the milf , which is yet to cross the final hurdle of being passed into law by the philippines congress . `` the best chance the southern philippines has ever had for peace may now be in jeopardy , '' read the report , which argued that the mamapasano fiasco was the result of a misguided emphasis on killing marwan . the report argued that , although marwan had aided terror attacks and provided funds and equipment to milf and abu sayyaf , he was not `` the master bomber that his reputation suggested . '' yet for the philippines authorities and their u.s. allies , killing marwan had become such a priority that security forces bypassed the mechanisms that had been established to alert the milf to such operations , for fear of word leaking to their target . the report quoted an anonymous indonesian associate of marwan 's who described the malaysian as `` a little snake who has been blown up into a dragon .

'' taiga ishikawa , tokyo councillor and the first male gay local assembly member in japan , told cnn the ordinance was a `` big first step for the protection of human rights . '' he called the decision `` happy '' but said that it must go alongside education about alternative lifestyles . he said that the most important part of today 's announcement is that it `` should be actually put into practice , as should education for understanding -lrb- lgbt individuals -rrb- especially they suffer as they find out their sexuality when they are young . '' neighboring setagaya ward has indicated that it would look into following shibuya 's lead . however , former councilor ishikawa cautioned against taking the movement 's momentum for granted . `` to realize equal rights for gay couples , a national law has to be made , '' he said . while outright discrimination against the lgbt community is rare in japan , its effects can be hidden and gay people often find themselves at a disadvantage . many hide their sexuality from their employers , co-workers , families and friends . but the tide may be turning . a recent poll found that a slight majority at 52.4 % oppose gay marriage , but support amongst young adults in their 20s and 30s is as high as 70 % . an editorial in the asahi shimbun newspaper , which commissioned the poll , welcomed the shibuya decision , calling it `` a bold and important step forward . '' only traditional marriages are recognized under japan 's constitution , but the wording is vague enough to open it to interpretation , according to mari miura , a professor of gender and politics at sophia university in tokyo . `` the constitution does not rule out same-sex marriage , so an interpretation can be made that it is constitutional , '' miura told bloomberg business . while prime minister shinzo abe and the ruling liberal democratic party `` do n't like the idea of same-sex marriage , but at the same time the issue is gaining momentum . '' conservative groups were vocal in their opposition , with one , known as the network pushing for normalization of education , telling the japan times that granting same-sex couples the same rights as all other japanese citizens would degrade the `` familial system and practice that heterosexual unions have long preserved in human history . '' while shibuya 's registration system will be a first for japan , yodogawa ward in the western japanese city of osaka was the first in the nation to recognize and support the lgbt community . in 2013 the ward government pledged to give consideration to the issues that the community faced , and to train staff to accommodate needs specific to lgbt individuals . journalist chie kobayashi contributed reporting from tokyo .",

'' i have no doubt that under paul 's leadership , he would indeed take our country back -- in the wrong direction -- way back to a time when we were debating the civil rights act -- which paul has done since landing on the national stage ; when there was no department of education -- a department he thinks `` should be done away with ; '' when women did n't have choices -- choices paul seeks to limit in washington ; when dreamers were n't protected from deportation -- protections paul currently opposes . in his inept speaking engagements at historically black colleges and universities , he has come across as condescending and lacking basic cultural competency . but paul has also questioned the civil rights act , and even claimed that private business owners have a right to discriminate . when asked about the need for a more robust voting rights act following the supreme court 's dismantling of the law , paul dismissively remarked , `` we have an african-american president . '' when president obama stood with john lewis and other veterans of the civil rights movement in front of the edmund pettus bridge last month to mark the 50th anniversary of bloody sunday , he inspired us all by saying : `` with effort , we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity . ... with effort , we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge -- and that is the right to vote . '' america is better -- and we solve more problems -- with more democracy , not less . unfortunately rand paul has demonstrated that he disagree with that basic principle . paul tried once again from that stage in louisville to fashion himself as the one member of his party courageous enough to try to broaden republican appeal to constituencies they ignore year after year . but his record makes it very clear that his views are outdated , outside of the mainstream , and disqualifying for a man who wants to lead our country . the american people deserve a leader who wo n't disrespect their intelligence , who wo n't pander to them when it 's convenient , and who wo n't work to dismantle the progress we have made over the last five decades . what i heard today , did n't change the facts about rand paul 's record . the american people deserve better than rand paul .",

'' twitter user yeshacallahan posted . appearing on cnn , washington defended the tweet , saying he wanted to `` excite a conversation . '' years ago , rock filmed a sketch for his `` chris rock '' show on hbo in which he detailed ways to avoid being beaten by police as a black man . besides obeying the law , he suggested bringing a white friend along for the ride . he did just that last year in a segment of `` comedians in cars getting coffee '' with jerry seinfeld . the two chat as seinfeld drives an orange lamborghini . and what happened ? they get pulled over after seinfeld goes a bit heavy on the gas . `` here 's the crazy thing , '' rock tells seinfeld as the police officer stops the duo . `` if you were n't here , i 'd be scared .

'' a representative for etihad airways told cnn that that the loss of pets during air travel is `` extremely rare . '' the airline shipped more than 200 pets last year . etihad airways is investigating the incident and is working with ground handlers at the new york airport to help locate the missing cat . the abu dhabi-based carrier also said it hired `` third-party specialists '' to help in the hunt for felix . `` we deeply regret this unfortunate incident and are keeping the owner apprised of the progress of the search , '' etihad airways told cnn in a statement . `` we will review our pet handling procedures in the wake of this incident , as the safety and care of pets traveling with etihad airways is a top priority . '' stewart and her husband booked the cat 's flight as part of their job relocation to the united states after living in abu dhabi for more than three years . the couple said they spent $ 1,200 to ship felix on the 14-hour flight . `` you pay all of this money , but for what ? people assume you pay extra to have your pets taken care of , but they 're treated no differently than a free piece of checked luggage , '' stewart said . it is n't the first time a pet has gone missing at new york 's busiest airport . in august 2011 , a cat escaped from its carrier before an american airlines flight from new york to san francisco . that cat was eventually discovered -- alive -- two months later in a customs room at the airport . but the cat later had to be euthanized because of injuries and malnutrition it suffered while lost . this weekend , stewart enlisted the help of a local nonprofit , which provided a highly trained detection dog , to help track down felix 's scent . a wildlife biologist who works with the airport has also placed traps to facilitate felix 's safe return , according to the port authority of new york and new jersey . officials at kennedy have offered to assist etihad airways as the airline investigates what happened , the port authority said . stewart said the couple will continue to search the airport until they have answers . `` we just want to find felix . but i just do n't know if we will , '' she said .",

'' the jury on tuesday morning began what is expected to be a lengthy deliberation process on 30 total charges , before the so-called penalty phase , should he be found guilty on any counts . it took prosecutors months to present 131 witnesses to support their claim that hernandez killed semi-pro player odin lloyd , yet on monday , hernandez 's defense team wrapped up its witnesses in less than a day . closing arguments are scheduled for tuesday , and the jury will begin deliberations soon thereafter . jurors in fall river , massachusetts , will be asked to decide if hernandez is culpable in the shooting death of lloyd , whose body was found in a massachusetts industrial park in the summer of 2013 . much of the evidence against hernandez is circumstantial , and among the facts the jury will be asked to take into consideration are new england patriots owner robert kraft 's testimony , the testimony of hernandez 's fiancee , some grainy footage from hernandez 's home security system and a footprint left by a nike air jordan shoe . hernandez known for swagger , even in court . ok , sure , no one was floored when the kentucky senator announced his bid for the oval office , but of course it was news when he made it official tuesday . paul is expected to hit the campaign trail visiting the all-important early voters in new hampshire , south carolina , iowa and nevada . the physician rode a wave of tea party popularity into the senate in 2010 , where he carefully built a brand of mainstream libertarianism , and he is banking on a coalition of younger voters and traditional republicans to usher him into the white house . paul and sen. ted cruz are the only declared candidates for the gop nomination , though the field will certainly grow and could include the likes of florida 's jeb bush , new jersey 's chris christie , wisconsin 's scott walker , south carolina 's lindsey graham and florida 's marco rubio . would rand be here without ron ? it 's the windy city 's first runoff for a citywide office , and it 's being billed as a battle for the `` future of chicago . '' in one corner , you have emanuel , president barack obama 's notoriously hard-charging former chief of staff , and in the other , you have jesus `` chuy '' garcia , a county commissioner who has come to embody populist and liberal democrats ' frustrations with the chicago incumbent . after emanuel failed to snare half the vote in february 's general election , he will go head-to-head with garcia . the timing is interesting , too , as easter , passover and spring break appear to have spurred more than 142,000 early votes , up from about 90,000 before the first round of voting in february . following michael brown 's death , the national spotlight shone on ferguson , particularly how the city 's predominantly black population is woefully underrepresented in its police force and city council . yet with all the hubbub about the face of civic leadership , only four in 10 city residents hit the polls in november to cast ballots . residents speak out ahead of vote . tuesday 's election will bring change , no matter how the ballots are cast : two black men are running for one of the open seats , and the current lone black council member is n't up for re-election . in another ward , two black women and two white men are vying for an open seat . and a white protester is running for a third post .",

'' now , prosecutors have accused zhou of `` taking advantage of his posts to seek benefits for others and illegally accepting huge amounts of money '' during his long political career . his alleged actions have caused heavy losses to public assets and greatly harmed national interests , they added . zhou was notified of his legal rights during the investigation and his lawyer 's views were heard , according to a statement by the prosecutors . his case will be tried in tianjin , a city near the chinese capital , beijing . the president of china 's supreme court recently told reporters there would be `` open '' trials for accused former leaders like zhou . however , the charge of leaking state secrets may allow authorities to shield certain legal proceedings from public view in zhou 's case . zhou has not been seen in public since he attended an anniversary event at his alma mater in october 2013 . he was expelled from the communist party and arrested last december . state media have painted an intricate web of officials , cronies and tycoons -- some with alleged mafia connections -- orbiting around zhou before the crumbling of his power structure last summer . zhou and his family members were said to have accumulated enormous wealth , in a blatant exchange between money and power . he was also found to have affairs with multiple women and allegedly traded power for sex , state-run xinhua news agency reported last year . analysts have viewed his shocking downfall as a watershed moment in the secretive world of chinese politics , now ruled by president xi jinping . xi has been spearheading a massive anti-corruption campaign , targeting both `` tigers '' and `` flies '' -- high-ranking , and low-level , officials . zhou is by far the biggest tiger caught in xi 's dragnet to date . `` the important thing here is that xi has proven he 's powerful enough to break this taboo of never incriminating former politburo standing committee members , '' longtime political analyst willy lam , a professor at the chinese university of hong kong , said last year , when the government revealed its formal investigation into zhou . many observers also note zhou 's patronage of bo xilai , a former communist leader sentenced to life in prison for corruption in 2013 . bo 's spectacular downfall the year before -- complete with tales of murder , bribery and betrayal -- attracted global attention . state media have cited his subsequent conviction as a prime example of xi 's resolve to clean up the party . the former chongqing communist party chief 's supporters , however , have long called him a political victim -- the former high-flying politician was once considered xi 's main challenger for the top spot of chinese leadership . political watchers see similarities between the bo and zhou cases . `` the people being investigated for corruption are on the losing side of factional struggles , '' said lam , who has predicted a suspended death sentence for zhou .",

'' heads of state from 35 countries in the western hemisphere have met every three years to discuss economic , social or political issues since the creation of the summit in 1994 . cuba has historically been the wrench in the diplomatic machinery , with some latin american leaders threatening not to attend the summit of the americas if the united states and canada did n't agree to invite president raul castro . the tide changed december 17 , 2014 , when president barack obama and castro announced that more than five decades of cold war rivalry was ending . diplomats from both countries immediately began negotiations to establish embassies in havana and washington , and the attention immediately focused on the summit of the americas , where for the first time since the about-face , obama and castro would come face-to-face . the much anticipated handshake between obama and castro would steal all the headlines if it was n't for cuba 's strongest ally , venezuela . venezuelan president nicolas maduro recently accused the united states of trying to topple his government and banned former president george bush , former vice president dick cheney , and senators bob menendez and marco rubio from entering venezuela . `` they ca n't enter venezuela because they 're terrorists , '' maduro said , blaming the american politicians for what he called terrorist actions in iraq , syria and vietnam . the u.s. state department said the allegations of u.s. involvement in a coup plot against maduro were `` baseless and false . '' later , obama issued an executive order sanctioning seven venezuelan officials for human rights violations and saying the country was a `` threat to national security . '' white house officials said every executive order includes that language , but it has sparked a fiery response from maduro , who has been collecting millions of signatures demanding the repeal of the order . he also asked for repeal in full-page ads in the new york times and in a panama city newspaper . maduro did n't stop there ; he has been rallying other latin american leaders , including bolivian president evo morales , ecuador 's rafael correa and nicaragua 's daniel ortega . but perhaps most damning for the united states -- and creating the `` triangle of tension '' at the summit -- cuban foreign minister bruno rodriguez has sided publicly with maduro . `` we reiterate our strong condemnation of the unacceptable and unjustifiable unilateral sanctions imposed against the sister nation of venezuela and the continued foreign interference with the purpose of creating a climate of instability in that sister nation . we ratify our firmest support to the bolivarian revolution and the legitimate government headed by president nicol\u00e1s maduro , '' rodriguez said . while the world watches for the photo-op of obama and castro , it 's unclear if more latin american diplomats will side with maduro , and for america , the vii summit of the americas could go from `` mi casa es su casa '' to a walk into the lion 's den .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- the outlines of a nuclear deal with iran are in place . unfortunately , it seems like too many in president barack obama 's administration have forgotten that the only reason this terrorist-supporting state came to the negotiating table in the first place was because of tough sanctions imposed by the u.s. congress . indeed , the reality is that president obama is giving up enormous leverage in his nuclear deal with iran -- and i worry we will lose it for good . bleeding money , and faced with falling oil prices , supreme leader ayatollah khamenei gave his government rare permission to bargain with the `` great satan '' -- the united states . but just as u.s. and european sanctions were forcing iran to the nuclear crossroads , president obama has given tehran an easy exit . for khamenei , the `` framework '' announced last week looks like a win-win : he gets to keep his nuclear infrastructure , and in return gets billions of dollars in sanctions relief . congress offered a better strategy when the top democrat on the foreign affairs committee , eliot engel , and i introduced a bill to hit tehran with its toughest sanctions yet . unfortunately , this bill -- which passed the house in a 400-20 vote -- was blocked in the senate last year , despite the fact that it would have sharpened the ayatollah 's choice : dismantle your nuclear weapons program or see your economy collapse . president obama once had a tougher line , when in 2012 he said : `` the deal we 'll accept is they end their nuclear program . it 's very straightforward . '' but the framework announced last week does nothing of the sort . negotiated between iran and the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany , the framework concedes that iran can maintain `` a mutually defined enrichment program , '' operate thousands of centrifuges , and continue its research and development of nuclear technologies . the deal currently on the table would hand tehran billions of previously sanctioned funds , filling the coffers of the world 's biggest state sponsor of terrorism , with strongholds in syria , iraq , yemen and lebanon . meanwhile , the strictest restrictions on iran 's enrichment will expire in only 10 years , despite the president receiving a letter from 367 members of congress -- both democrats and republicans -- in which we insisted that `` verifiable constraints on iran 's nuclear program must last for decades . '' the president admitted as much when he conceded that `` in year 13 , 14 , 15 , they have advanced centrifuges that enrich uranium fairly rapidly , and at that point the breakout times would have shrunk almost down to zero . '' but as bad as these concessions are , the most concerning aspect of the april 2 deal is that it lacks tough safeguards to stop iran from cheating . the key question is this : will the inspectors at the international atomic energy agency be allowed to inspect these military sites without warning ? because if the iaea can not conduct `` anytime , anywhere '' inspections , iran will be able to `` sneak out '' to a bomb . it has been done before . remember , in 1994 , when president bill clinton told us he had struck a deal with north korea that would `` make the united states , the korean peninsula , and the world safer '' ? president clinton sounded a little too much like the current secretary of state john kerry , when he promised that the north korea agreement `` does not rely on trust '' and that `` compliance will be certified by the international atomic energy agency . '' twelve years after these assurances , north korea detonated its first nuclear bomb . iran could easily do the same . the best predictor of its future behavior is its past behavior -- between 2004 and 2009 , the iranian government built a huge centrifuge facility named fordo under a mountain deep in the iranian desert . luckily for the world , western intelligence agencies discovered tehran 's deception . but we can not rely on such luck in the future , particularly when iran still has n't come clean about its history of secret weapons development and is still dodging basic questions from the iaea . let 's not forget the other things iran has been doing while its diplomats have been bargaining with the u.s. and its partners . while iran was showing its friendly new face to the world , it has simultaneously been helping syrian dictator bashar al assad kill his own people , training and funding the terrorist group hezbollah , which aims to annihilate israel , and supporting the houthis , who started a civil war and overthrew the government in yemen -- one of america 's more reliable counterterrorism partners in the region . if president obama is going to hand over billions of dollars to a regime that behaves like this , run by a man who publicly declares : `` death to america , '' it has to be a better deal . the framework we have before us keeps iran 's nuclear door well and truly open .",

'' o'malley , like other democrats , appears to refrain from directly attacking clinton . although last month on abc , he said that the presidency is `` not some crown to be passed between two families , '' he has not focused on her . he has , however , openly teased a presidential run . `` i know that , as democrats , we expect -- and i have heard this all over the country -- the democrats expect a robust conversation about the issues we face as a nation and the challenges we face , '' he said . `` they believe that that conversation needs to take place in something as important as a presidential primary .

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- a year after its cannes debut and finally seeing a theatrical release , `` lost river '' is still causing quite a stir . booed at its premiere and mocked by reviewers , ryan gosling 's first feature as director has been divisive , to put it mildly . but there has been one shining light cutting through the fog of critical hyperbole : its setting , a besmirched and decaying detroit . wavering on the brink of annihilation , yet providing kindling for its own rebirth , the city is captured in all its waning splendor , the perfect backdrop for gosling 's post-industrial gothic . speaking about the film in london , gosling made clear that the city was at the heart of the project -- in fact , without detroit 's crumbling edifices there would be no film at all . gosling said that `` lost river '' began as a collection of speculative shots of the brewster-douglass projects , the first black social housing development in america and a place motown legends the supremes and boxer joe louis once called home . `` i heard -lsb- the authorities -rsb- were going to tear them down , '' gosling said . `` i had to shoot them before they did . '' taking time out between acting jobs , he ventured into the projects . `` i started shooting more and more , '' he explained , `` and then i realized that i was making a film . then i started writing -lsb- the script -rsb- during the process of filming . '' gosling 's affection for the motor city is longstanding , the actor growing up `` not too far away '' in cornwall , ontario . `` it seemed like everything cool came from detroit ... the whole american dream , '' he reminisces . `` the model-t , motown , the refrigerator ... '' now though he references `` 40 miles of dead neighborhoods , '' the city declaring bankruptcy . `` houses are burning and things are being torn down , '' he says , `` and within that there are families trying to hold on to their homes . for them it has become a nightmare and i wanted to make a film about that . '' the title itself alludes to a once thriving community now displaced , its homes at the bottom of a reservoir built with little concern for the residents -- man-made interference with untold social repercussions . speaking in broader terms , gosling argues `` there are lost rivers everywhere and we wanted to share the experience these people were having . '' on screen he paints a nihilistic image of wanton destruction ; torched properties and bulldozers jostling for our attention amid acts of extreme human violence -- sometimes self-inflicted . the director plainly states that as a location it `` was pretty dangerous . '' he describes `` an energy there that was threatening ... we had a very charmed experience -lsb- filming -rsb- . it worked its way into the fabric of the movie -- a tone of impending threat that was just there . '' however there are signs of humanity and regeneration amongst the chaos , on camera and off . for the film 's young protagonist , every raid on an unoccupied house offers copper piping waiting to be recast and ultimately reclaimed . similarly , gosling references the heidelberg project during the discussion , a community organization in the city 's mcdougall-hunt neighborhood , reimagining derelict buildings as giant canvases for budding artists . he recalls seeing `` one house covered with teddy bears , another covered in clocks ... people taking spaces and personalizing them . '' the city 's scope for urban renewal was clearly a draw . `` something really interesting is happening in detroit at the moment -- a rebirth . people redefining what they are , '' according to gosling . `` there 's a resilience there and an energy , and it 's exciting . '' as much as the visual content of `` lost river '' revolves around a maudlin preoccupation with dereliction -- and perhaps plays on the outside world 's perception of detroit -- aspects of the narrative suggest hope and the possibility of reincarnation for the city . gosling claims this paradox should exist when discussing detroit , and is precisely what the film is trying to convey . `` we want people to know that dereliction is happening there , but that it 's not only what is happening there , '' he argues . `` it does n't define detroit , it 's just part of what it 's dealing with right now . '' `` lost river '' receives a limited theatrical release in the u.s. and uk on april 10 .",

'' berman was shot in the head in her beverly hills home in december 2000 , shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the 1982 disappearance of durst 's first wife , kathleen mccormack durst . durst has long maintained that he had nothing to do with berman 's death or his wife 's disappearance . it 's not the first time he has been accused of murder . he admitted killing and dismembering his neighbor at a 2003 trial , but he was acquitted after arguing that he acted in self-defense . fbi agents have also asked local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where durst lived over the past five decades , a u.s. law enforcement official said . unsolved cases in vermont , upstate new york , the san francisco bay area and southern california are among those getting a new look , the official said . durst 's attorney , dick deguerin , said it 's a sign that authorities are desperate . deguerin has said durst has serious medical conditions . he is suffering from hydrocephalus , which required brain surgery a couple of years ago , deguerin said . doctors implanted a stent on the right side of his head , the attorney said . `` at the same time he was in the hospital , he had an operation on his esophagus to remove cancer . so he 's got some serious health issues . ... he 's lost a lot of weight . he 's not in good health , '' deguerin said . deguerin also said that durst is `` mildly autistic '' and has received treatment in the past from one of the country 's leading experts in asperger 's syndrome and autism .",

'' kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl will meet with senior syrian officials , u.n. and relief agency staff members , and displaced people from the camp itself . the yarmouk refugee camp , which sits just 6 miles from central damascus , has been engulfed in fighting between the syrian government and armed groups since december 2012 . the london-based syrian observatory for human rights says the militant group isis and the al qaeda-affiliated al-nusra front control about 90 % of the camp . the organization also claims that the syrian government has dropped barrel bombs on the camp as recently as sunday in an effort to drive out armed groups . yarmouk was formed in 1957 to accommodate people displaced by the arab-israeli conflict and is the largest palestinian refugee camp in syria . the u.n. relief agency estimates that there were 160,000 people in the camp when the conflict began in 2011 between forces loyal to president bashar al-assad and opposition fighters . that number has dropped to about 18,000 , according to estimates . yarmouk has been largely cut off from aid since november 2013 . there have been widespread reports of malnutrition and shortages of medical care . `` we will not abandon hope , '' gunness said . `` we will not submit to pessimism , because to abandon hope would be to abandon the people of yarmouk . ... we can not abandon the people of yarmouk , and we will not , hence this mission .

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- recently , a new york judge issued an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband completely via facebook . what exactly is `` service of process '' ? serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premised on one guiding principle : if you are going to sue someone , you should at least let them know about it . sounds simple , right ? in theory it is . in practice , it turns out people do n't like being sued . it also turns out that , to many defendants , procrastination of a lawsuit is a viable defense . just as you may avoid bad news in life , defendants tend to avoid process servers . once a defendant has been served , that means the judicial proceedings begin . unfortunately , that means defendants have an incentive to go `` off the grid '' . although every state is different , the law of service of process has evolved this way : the ideal and fairest way to notify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person , and have some proof that the person was the defendant . in-person service is not always possible , for obvious reasons . so , the law had to develop methods of alternate service , but carefully balance a defendant 's right to have notice of a lawsuit , against a diligent plaintiff 's access to court if a defendant is avoiding the inevitable . as reliable as the u.s. mail is , regular mail is not a reliable form of serving papers . not because the postmen ca n't be trusted ; they can . neither snow , nor rain , nor heat , nor gloom of night , will keep them from delivering those papers . instead , it 's defendants -- no wait , all of humanity -- that ca n't be trusted . every one of us has ignored mail or even pretended we did n't get it . defendants are no different . one form of alternate service is `` nail and mail '' service . this means that you take a hammer and nail , and nail the papers to the defendant 's front door . the problem with that is that many defendants are nomadic by nature . just because you find a house that a defendant stayed at , does n't mean he 'll be back there anytime soon . another , even odder form of `` service '' is service by publication . this is an almost laughable legal fiction . if you ca n't find a defendant , a judge might let you serve by publication . that means that a plaintiff can take out an ad in five point font for a week in an obscure publication , on the off chance you are reading the classified ads of the secaucus law journal looking for lawsuits against you . as laughable as serving someone by tweeting it sounds , it 's at least more rational than this antiquated method . at first blush , the idea of service by facebook seems to offend traditional notions of ensuring notification of a defendant of a case against him . when it comes to serving papers , however , `` traditional '' does n't necessarily mean `` good . '' service by publication or nailing paper to the door of an empty apartment is hardly reliable ; it 's just service of last resort . for those people who are concerned that being served papers will become a facebook announcement in a news feed , along with the photos of dinner or kittens , to be `` liked '' by all your gawking `` friends , '' we 're not quite there ... yet . while the older forms of alternate service were public , most electronic service takes the form of email . where email is n't available , it is facebook private messaging , which should be as private as email . that 's the form of service authorized by the court here . so for now , we 're not quite putting lawsuits on instagram ... but i would n't rule it out in the future . online service may be a new frontier , but it 's not unheard of . most of us exist more online now than we `` live '' in a particular condo , or mom 's basement . virtually everyone has a phone or access to the internet . not everyone has a lease or a mortgage . plus , online service has the added benefit of tracking . believe me , somewhere , some computer has already logged the fact that you read this article , how long you read it , and even how far down you scrolled before you got bored and bailed on the article -lrb- thanks for still being here , by the way -rrb- . in a way , maybe online service is long overdue . you can outrun a process server for a while , but sooner or later , all of us have to go back online -- and no human can outrun an email .",

'' wang told cnn that prosecutors had to decide whether to pursue the charges within seven days of the submission -- by monday . `` we hope that the prosecutors will not approve a formal arrest warrant , following the laws and standing up to pressure , '' he said . `` but nobody knows what to expect till monday ; we can do nothing but wait . '' the five were initially held on suspicion of `` picking quarrels and provoking trouble . '' wang said he did n't know why the charge against the women changed . `` neither should constitute a crime , '' he said . campaign group amnesty international said the new charge was less serious but still carried a maximum jail term of five years . `` the women were doing nothing wrong , nothing illegal . they were simply calling for an end to sexual harassment , '' william nee , china researcher at amnesty international told cnn . `` everything they were doing was in line with china 's own laws and policies . '' wang said that wei had been subject to lengthy cross examinations during her detention but was well the last time they met on march 31 . two of the women are said to be in poor health . he added that the charges relate both to the activities the women planned for international women 's day and earlier campaigns against domestic violence and for more public toilets for women . the five -- who are members of china 's women 's rights action group -- had planned to hand out stickers printed with slogans saying `` stop sexual harassment , let us stay safe '' and `` go police , go arrest those who committed sexual harassment ! '' on women 's day . the detention of wei , along with wu rongrong , li tingting , wang man and zheng churan has drawn harsh criticism from the international community . protests have taken place in several cities , including hong kong , that urge chinese officials to `` free the five .

'' the girls were abducted on the night of april 14-15 , 2014 , in the town of chibok , in northeastern nigeria , about a two-hour drive from the border with cameroon . the government girls secondary school had been closed for a month because of the danger posed by boko haram militants , who are opposed to western education , particularly for girls . but students from several schools had been called in to take a final exam in physics . the militants stormed the school , arriving in a convoy of trucks and buses and engaging in a gun battle with school security guards . then they forced the girls from their dormitories , loaded them into trucks and drove them into the forest . most have never been seen since , except in a photograph in which they sat on the ground in a semi-circle , clad in islamic dress . they were between 16 and 18 years old . police said the militants kidnapped 276 girls in all . about 50 managed to escape soon after they were abducted . those who did not , it is feared , may have been raped , brutalized , enslaved and forced to convert to islam . their parents were stricken with grief . the world was appalled . on twitter , a hashtag began trending and spread around the world : #bringbackourgirls . on tuesday , malala yousafzai , the 17-year-old pakistani girl who was shot in the face for speaking out in favor of girls ' education , sent a message to the kidnapped girls . `` i am one of the millions of people around the world who keep you and your families foremost in our thoughts and prayers , '' she wrote . `` we can not imagine the full extent of the horrors you have endured . but please know this : we will never forget you . '' one year later , a few things have changed . each of the missing girls has had a birthday in captivity . each is now a year older . nigeria 's current president , goodluck jonathan , was defeated in his campaign for re-election , in part , it is thought , because he failed to effectively combat boko haram . buhari , the incoming president , has pledged an aggressive effort to wipe out the group . but much remains unchanged , as well . boko haram still controls swathes of northeastern nigeria . according to unicef , 800,000 children have been forced to flee their homes because of the conflict between the nigerian military , civilian self-defense groups , and boko haram . amnesty international says women and children continue to be abducted . and it says boko haram continues to kill in large numbers . beyond that , more than 200 schoolgirls who had gathered one year ago to take their science exam are still missing . their families are still bereft . and tuesday on twitter , a hashtag was still trending : #bringbackourgirls .",

'' supporters of the measure described it as a groundbreaking step , while opponents warned it was dangerous and among the most restrictive abortion laws in the country . the law does not spell out a specific time frame that limits when an abortion can occur , but it bans the dilation and evacuation abortion procedure commonly used during the second trimester of pregnancy . the law allows for the procedure if `` necessary to protect the life or health of the mother , '' according to a statement on brownback 's website . on twitter , brownback , a republican , said he was proud to sign a law `` protecting life at its most vulnerable stage .

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- what would you do if a complete stranger asked you for $ 100 , or offered you an apple in a parking lot without explanation ? these are only two of the 100 challenges chinese-born , american-based jia jiang put himself up to when he decided to blog about `` 100 days of rejection '' , a project he launched after he quit his comfortable six-figure job to follow his dreams of being an entrepreneur at the age of 30 , just weeks before his first child was born . after his tech start-up was declined investment , jiang decided to confront his fear of rejection head-on . this led to his writing his book called rejection proof , part self-help and part motivational/autobiography , which is being released this week . famously , in 2012 on his third day of the project , jiang asked austin , texas , krispy kreme manager -lrb- jackie braun -rrb- to make him five interlinked donuts to mimic the olympic symbol . to his surprise , she rose to the challenge and his rejection request faltered . he shared his video and it went viral on reddit . before long , jiang -lrb- and braun -rrb- were invited on talk shows and jiang was being asked to speak at events across the us . jiang was even offered jobs as his project continued and his fame grew . that was n't the goal of the project though . `` i 'm really just a person trying to overcome my own fears , '' explained jiang . the project started out to help `` fix my own problems , and now i 'm helping others fix theirs , '' he said . `` the fear of rejection really holds people back . i 'm trying to demystify the idea of rejection . '' jiang , who as a child dreamed of being bill gates and has been viewed 7 million times on youtube , has found his entrepreneurial dream in a different role for the moment . `` my goal is to turn rejection into opportunity . i always thought it was something to run away from , but if we can embrace it , we can turn it into a lot more than an obstacle . '' 8 top tips in making rejection work for you : . 1 - the fear of rejection holds us back a lot more than actual rejection . by putting ourselves out there , the world will usually open itself up to you . though the world can seem cruel and cold , actually humans have a hard time saying no . so open yourself up , do n't be afraid to ask for something . if you fail , remember it 's not about you . 2 - rejection is more or less a numbers game . sometimes the most far-fetched idea gets a yes . if you talk to enough people , somebody will say yes to you . j.k. rowling went through 12 rejections to get her yes for harry potter and the philosopher 's stone . 3 - you can not use rejection to measure the merit of an idea . sometimes if you really want to change the world , getting rejection is a must . rejection is a human interaction with two sides . it often says more about the rejector than the rejectee , and should never be used as the universal truth and sole judgment of merit . 4 - do n't run away after a no . the most common thing we do when we 're rejected is we want to run because rejection is painful - you 're hurt , angry and you lose confidence . but actually if we know how to handle it , we can often minimize the chance of rejection . be confident , engaging , collaborate . i used all of these traits to maximise getting a yes . 5 - ask why ? when you get rejected you have to find out why . then spend time to find solutions to solve that why . sometimes through this process you learn there is something else you can ask for . ask for an intermediate position rather than the top position . 6 - set a number of how many no 's you can take . in his book , jiang helps his wife set out to get her dream job at google . he tells her that instead of thinking about getting a job , she needs to prepare herself for how many no 's she can take . in the end , she was offered a job at google . 7 - be invincible . by the end of his project , jiang said he felt he could ask anything from anyone and not have the pain of rejection . it was a gradual process - gradually my comfort zone expanded . it 's like a muscle , i could become stronger and stronger . 8 - stand tall and remember rejection is an opinion . people are who they are . a lot of people will reject you because of their mood , their education , their upbringing , and you ca n't change who they are . but you can stand confidently . innate confidence comes across . how missing sleep can damage your iq . the surprising benefits of doing nothing . 7 habits of highly ineffective people .",

'' for centuries , these plays and three dozen more by william shakespeare have formed history 's most heralded literary canon . but now they may have to make room for an addition to shakespeare 's famous oeuvre . new research indicates that `` double falsehood , '' a play first published in 1728 by lewis theobald , was actually written more than a century earlier by shakespeare himself with help from his friend john fletcher . the findings were published this week by two scholars who used computer software to analyze the writings of the three men and compare it with the language of the `` newer '' play . `` the match between the ` double falsehood ' play and shakespeare was a landslide . it was shockingly clear , '' said ryan l. boyd , a researcher at the university of texas at austin . the study , co-authored by boyd and ut colleague james w. pennebaker , was published in the journal psychological science . `` there 's very little wiggle room to interpret the numbers any differently . '' boyd said he and pennebaker analyzed 33 plays by shakespeare , nine by fletcher and 12 by theobald to create a `` psychological signature '' of each author based on word choices , phrase patterns and other factors . they compared those profiles to the language in `` double falsehood '' and determined that the play 's first half was almost entirely written by shakespeare , though the second half appeared to be split evenly between shakespeare and fletcher . only tiny traces of theobald 's signature were found . `` we 're certainly not suggesting that theobald did n't make edits , '' boyd told cnn . `` but he clearly did not write it . '' `` double falsehood , '' also known as `` the distressed lovers , '' is based on the `` cardenio '' section of don quixote , the classic 17th-century novel by miguel de cervantes . set in spain , the play revolves around the romantic entanglements of two brothers : one virtuous , one sinful . theobald said he based the play on three original manuscripts he had discovered , all of them written by shakespeare . but many scholars have long dismissed the play as a fake , suspecting that theobald tried to pass the bard 's work off as his own . shakespeare , who died in 1616 , wrote most of his published plays between 1590 and 1612 . british publishers arden shakespeare published `` double falsehood '' in 2010 -- for the first time in 250 years -- amid renewed claims by experts that it was shakespeare 's work . but the new study by boyd and pennebaker , the first to analyze the writings from a psychological perspective , may settle the matter once and for all . shakespearean scholar brean hammond , professor of modern english literature at nottingham university in the uk , praised the texas study for its scientific approach . hammond said boyd and pennebaker `` have got no dogs in the fight . they 're not literary scholars , -lrb- so -rrb- their work could be seen as more objective than some of the literary studies . '' hammond studied `` double falsehood 's '' authorship from a literary perspective five years ago and found shakespeare 's dna evident in the play . but he doubts the new research will put the matter entirely to rest . `` those people who do n't believe the play was written by shakespeare are n't going to just lay down and die , '' he said .",

'' yet , afalava has been denied the right to vote because the federal government insists that he is no citizen . how can it be , in the 21st century , that americans born on u.s. soil are denied the rights of citizenship ? that injustice clouds the recent celebration of the 115th anniversary of the decision of american samoa to join the united states . it is a wrong that afalava and other american samoans are now seeking to right in a federal lawsuit before the d.c. circuit . a decision could come any day . since the united states was established , it adhered to the rule that those born on u.s. lands were u.s. citizens . the rule is colorblind , yet the only exception that the supreme court has ever declared was not . the infamous dred scott case legitimized slavery as it declared that free african-americans had `` no rights that the white man was bound to respect . '' though they were americans , they were not citizens under the constitution . a civil war later , the 14th amendment reversed the ruling in the dred scott case . today , the dred scott case has come to be regarded as one of the worst decisions in the history of the supreme court . but racial discrimination did n't end there . in 1904 , a puerto rican woman named isabel gonzalez sailed for new york . because puerto rico was u.s. territory , she believed herself to be a u.s. citizen . but officials at ellis island labeled her an undesirable alien and prevented her from entering the mainland . she sued , with some reason to hope for a favorable ruling . yet the supreme court that eventually heard gonzalez 's case was still racist . in preceding years , for example , it had permitted a flat ban on naturalizing anyone of the chinese race . and , in a case addressing the status of recently acquired island territories such as puerto rico , the justices had cited the alleged racial inferiority of tropical peoples as reason to treat these lands as second-class u.s. territories . justice edward douglas white 's opinion stated that u.s. sovereignty extended over them , but that their residents did not hold the same constitutional rights as other americans . he did so , he privately revealed , because `` he was much preoccupied by the danger of racial and social questions . '' in the gonzalez case , the justices agreed unanimously that puerto ricans were not aliens and thus not subject to immigration laws . but they declined to decide whether or not gonzalez was a citizen . though preoccupied by fears that islanders were `` savages '' and racially unfit for citizenship , they were unwilling to violate the constitution . as a result of the court ruling , federal officials were able to deny gonzalez and others the full panoply of rights conferred on citizens for years . as isabel gonzalez 's lawyer told the court , declaring that residents of america 's island territories are not u.s. citizens would mean adding to `` precedents in our history of which we are least proud . '' those precedents , he warned the court , had been `` repudiated by the american people in the civil war , by three amendments to the constitution of the united states , by this court , and by ... advancing civilization . '' surely , 147 years after the dred scott case was overturned , the time has come to put an end to this farce . in the past century , the inhabitants of every other u.s. island territory have become citizens . today , emy afalava and his fellow american samoans are the last americans still waiting to become citizens .",

'' but it would be interesting to hear what any of the 2016 gop presidential candidates might have to say about `` gay emojis . '' and i would predict some conservative will claim that the kissing gay emojis will turn children gay . the fact is , when you embrace diversity , you will still leave out other minority groups . redheads , for example , are pretty pissed off because there are no emojis featuring their hair color . in fact , supporters of a redheaded emoji have started a petition that has already garnered several thousand signatures . even expanding the flags represented by emojis , as apple has done , comes at some peril . apparently canada is overjoyed that finally apple has included it . but armenians are not happy they were left out . i must admit that being partially of palestinian heritage , it 's heartening to see that despite the fact that some refuse to recognize a palestinian state , apple has chosen to now include a palestinian flag emoji . armenia , i feel your pain . of course the bigger question in the whole diverse-emoji issue is : what took apple so long ? how hard could it have been to add different skin colors to pick from ? that the company -lrb- finally -rrb- did is a step in the right direction : america 's demographics are changing , so our representations of who we are -- even representations as tiny as emojis -- should reflect this . apple has `` evolved '' in showing diversity -- from brown people to same-sex couples . maybe `` religious liberty '' conservatives who discriminate will follow .",

'' so , how exactly should we read this information ? what does it say about the wider fight against isis ? cnn asked afzal ashraf , a counterinsurgency specialist and consulting fellow at the royal united services institute to give us a steer on what this new data tells us about the fight against isis in iraq . below is an edited version of the conversation . cnn : so , is the tide turning in iraq -- is the coalition winning ? afzal ashraf : when it comes to insurgencies it 's always problematic to think about the tide turning in terms of territorial gains because insurgencies by their very nature are extremely good at adapting to change . the one difference between isis and insurgencies in general is that isis declared itself a state , a caliphate once had territory so any loss is very strategic loss of prestige and image for them . -lrb- there have been -rrb- significant gains against isis -- particularly in tikrit -- and it 's no coincidence we 've seen isis make spectacular attacks in refugee centers in syria . it 's asymmetric warfare , they know they can not hold conventional force back for very long so what they do is they withdraw ... then take initiative elsewhere . they have to distract attention from those losses by gains and attacks elsewhere . it continues their image of initiative , of shocking , of reshaping the world -- which is what they are trying to do . cnn : what does the map tell us about the coalition 's strategy ? aa : it 's very telling . there are losses but most of the losses are around the edges of their territory and what that means is a very conventional push forward by the iraqi forces . it 's a push against the front line of isis rather than being brave and creative and going in behind isis 's lines and breaking it up . what this is n't is using maneuverist warfare -- which is a military philosophy that exploits the capabilities of conventional forces to project power by using air forces to take land along main supply routes and put friendly forces on that land to cut land into chunks which causes massive disruption to command and control and their supply chains which can cause forces to collapse much more rapidly than a frontal push . the capability you need -lrb- for this kind of warfare -rrb- is much more high-tech than the capabilities the iraqis have . those capabilities are available in the region -- jordanians , egyptians and other forces have helicopters and aircraft -- and it 's very interesting that the middle eastern nations have not developed an effective coalition to target isis which is an existential threat . cnn : what about ramadi ? isis seems to be winning there . aa : ramadi has been a potential battlefield for the past decade . but in this context -lrb- isis -rrb- will ... be pushing in ramadi because that 's an area they have lots of support . it also diverts their attention away from losses to their gains . the concept of success is hugely important to them -- it 's what sustains the recruitment effort of isis . nobody wants to join a bunch of losers , so it 's very important for them to be seen to be succeeding . above all this is a rhetorical war that is being fought deliberately in the media . they are losing so of course they are going to try to distract us by destroying ancient statues in nimrud and killing refugees in camps like yarmouk . but where it counts they are not standing and fighting .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- even in the horror of syria 's civil war , there are few places that showcase the scale of the destruction -- and the senselessness of the loss of life -- more than the yarmouk camp on the outskirts of damascus . set up as a refugee camp for palestinians in the 1950s , it slowly evolved into a neighborhood over the years , but since 2012 it has been engulfed in the syrian conflict . two weeks ago isis fighters stormed yarmouk , and that made life for those still inside even worse than it was before . the syrian government responded by unleashing a bombing and shelling campaign on the area , residents told cnn , including barrel bombs that flattened many of the buildings already scarred by the three-year-long conflict . death comes day and night . `` i looked up and saw dust , '' one resident said . `` i opened the door and started walking outside and started shouting to the neighbors . one told me ' i am wounded , ' another one did n't answer me at all . that second one -- may god have mercy on his soul -- he was martyred . '' while the battle for yarmouk is very typical of syria 's civil war , the conflict here is unique . most of those fighting on all sides are palestinians . pro-government factions besiege the area from the outside , cutting off supplies and aid most of the time . the inside is held by anti-regime groups , some of which are islamists . the situation in yarmouk was thrust in to the headlines on april 1 when isis fighters stormed the rebel-held area and unleashed a campaign of violence and killings . since then , a local activist tells cnn , isis has withdrawn to another area and left the al qaedalinked group jabhat al-nusra in charge of the district . ` the deepest circle of hell ' : terrified yarmouk residents describe isis raid . but this is only the most recent in a deadly urban war that is slowly grinding down yarmouk 's buildings and people . of the more than 100,000 that used to live there , only about 18,000 remain , according to unrwa , the u.n. agency tasked with aiding palestinians . i have been to yarmouk on various occasions , and the picture has always been the same . pro-government factions surrounded the area and there was house-to house combat , mostly at night . a lot of destruction , very little territorial gain for either side , all of it taking a horrifying toll on the civilians trapped in the middle . `` we have no food or water , '' one resident said , standing amid the ruins of yarmouk 's houses . `` they should open a route so we can eat and drink and they can deliver assistance and food . we have nothing . what can we do ? '' but international aid groups can do very little . there are few occasions where aid is allowed into yarmouk , or where civilians are allowed out . unrwa can only care for those who do manage to escape . u.n. official to visit besieged refugee camp . the agency , along with the syrian arab red crescent , runs several shelters for displaced people in government-controlled areas near the camp . pierre krahenbuhl , the commissioner general for unrwa , recently visited some of them and acknowledged that far too little help was reaching those who need it most . `` we have to call on the world and call on all the actors in the world who can influence the situation to mobilize , '' krahenbuhl said . `` but much more has to be done to respect the civilians and to make sure that they are safe inside the camp . '' but of course those still inside are by no means safe -- subjected to shelling , bombing and street combat on top of being thirsty , hungry and in need of medication . but one thing that has not been broken is the residents ' self-respect and pride . `` this is yarmouk camp and we are not leaving our homes , '' one man said . `` whatever happens , if they keep hitting us with barrel bombs we will die . '' an elderly woman recalled her life as a palestinian refugee . `` i fled palestine when i was seven years old , '' she said . `` but i will not leave the yarmouk camp even if i am 75 or 76 years old . yarmouk camp is equal to my soul . i built it with my bare hands . i carried its stones on my head from a village and laid the foundation to my home . block by block i carried them on my head . '' but despite their defiance , there 's seemingly nothing that can be done to prevent yarmouk from being reduced to rubble . this is a war of attrition , two sides fighting for inches in tough combat without seeing that they are wrecking the prize they claim to be fighting for . desperation for palestinians trapped in syrian refugee camp .",

'' twenty-nine elephants currently live here , and 13 more will join the group by 2018 , after ringling bros. decided this year to stop using elephants in its traveling circus . `` this was a decision that our family had discussed for quite some time , '' said feld , chairman and ceo of feld entertainment , the company that owns ringling bros. and barnum & bailey . the change comes after years of repeated criticism and lawsuits by animal rights groups . the ultimate decision to phase out the elephants , feld said , is the result of the different laws regulating the use of the animals in each of the 115 cities the circus visits every year . `` you ca n't operate any business , much less with animals , if you do n't have consistency from city to city , '' feld said . `` it 's a definite expense to be in litigation and to be fighting legislation , and there is a saying and it 's been around for a long time : ` you ca n't fight city hall . ' and we found that to be the case in this situation . '' the circus business has been a part of the feld family since 1967 , when irvin feld purchased ringling bros. and barnum & bailey . when irvin died in 1984 , his son , kenneth , took over . `` this is a whole family affair , '' he said . `` it 's a family affair for our family but also for all the elephants . '' when the center opened 20 years ago , it housed fewer than 10 elephants . `` it was a place for elephants to retire , '' feld said . today , the center houses elephants of all ages . `` we have lots of different elephants , meaning males and females , youth elephants , older elephants , so it is a great place to study behavior , '' he said . the center is also focused on breeding the animals . wendy kiso , a research and conservation scientist , spends her days at an onsite lab , trying to figure out how to keep the species from going extinct . part of her lab includes several tanks that `` cryo-preserve '' elephant sperm at negative-196 degrees . `` we process the semen and we extend it in such a way that we can freeze it , '' kiso said . `` this is a genetic resource bank for asian elephants . '' twenty-six elephants have been born here , feld said . mike , the newest pachyderm to join the group , was born at the center 's birthing barn nearly two years ago . `` we have the largest and only sustainable herd of asian elephants in the western hemisphere , '' feld said . caring for the elephants is no small task . trudy williams and her husband , jim , spend their time taking care of the animals ' daily needs . it takes the couple hours to bathe , walk and feed the elephants every day . `` first thing in the morning , we water them , and give them some treats and feed them some hay , '' williams said . each elephant eats about 150 pounds of food a day . twenty-one tons of hay usually lasts only 10 days at the center . exercise is also part of the daily routine , including stretching . `` we just do that a few times on each leg with them , just to give them a good stretch , '' williams said . `` we do some footwork with them . all of our elephants , generally once a month , get a pedicure , just to make sure their feet are in good condition . '' all of this care is n't cheap . `` each elephant costs over $ 65,000 a year , per year , over all the years of their life , '' feld said . `` we 're fortunate we 're for profit . we do make a profit and we 're a privately owned family business , and so we 've made a decision we want to devote a lot of resources here . '' it 's a price feld said he 's willing to pay to keep this species -- some varieties of which in asia and africa are endangered -- alive for generations to come . `` i always say , it 's sort of like jurassic park with a happy ending , '' feld said . `` we knew that if we did n't do something , maybe my grandchildren would never have the opportunity to see these incredible animals .

'' channing tatum doing his thing : when the cast of `` magic mike xxl '' presented j.lo with the scared as shit performance award , she asked them exactly what we were all thinking : `` why are n't you dancing ? '' channing tatum obliged , popping a twerk -lrb- in a suit -rrb- onstage in front of lopez . `` your turn , '' he told her . sadly , she did not oblige . amy schumer takes on hillary clinton , zayn malik and more in monologue . rebel wilson 's censored moment : introducing an exclusive clip from `` pitch perfect 2 '' as an `` exclusive clit '' was easily the funniest non-schumer joke of the entire night . even her castmates seemed shocked when she slipped it in . fall out boy meets fetty wap : `` centuries '' did n't need a rap breakdown , nor did `` trap queen '' need a punk-rock edge . but did it sound killer on both counts ? hell yeah . fetty with an electric guitar is something that needs to happen again . charli xcx , ty dolla $ ign & tinashe : there 's a reason charli gets invited to every mtv awards show : she attacks a pop song with the abandon of a rock 'n' roll tidal wave . `` drop that kitty '' was tinashe 's time to shine , though . it 's only a shame she got about 30 seconds to command the stage . kiss cam : amy schumer sensuously kissing amber rose just before a commercial break ? well played , amy . kevin hart 's comedic genius award : while kimmel 's intro jokes were a little one-note -lrb- we get it , kevin is short -rrb- , it was pretty adorable that hart brought his kids onstage to accept his golden popcorn . as his son held it , you realized the award was bigger than the kid 's head . mtv movie awards : see all the photos . robert downey jr. accepting generation award : his speech was fine -lrb- kudos for the `` keep your nose clean '' quip -rrb- , but his avengers castmates taking a knee while he accepted his award was just perfect . misfires . archery fail : schumer 's bow-and-arrow misfire was a literal misfire . it was n't a big deal , but the fact that it ruined an entire gag -lrb- with jimmy kimmel pretending to get shot in the chest -rrb- was naturally awkward . of course , schumer poked fun at herself almost immediately . `` gone girl '' joke : `` how good was gone girl ? it 's the story of what one crazed white woman -- or every latina -- does when a man cheats on them , '' schumer joked . it was n't awful , just kinda off . mtv immediately cut to j.lo laughing like `` ummm , ok '' -- which is an accurate response . vin diesel sings ` furious 7 ' paul walker tribute song at mtv movie awards . shailene woodley speech : woodley definitely marches to the beat of her own drum , which is part of her appeal . but halfway through her trailblazer award acceptance speech , the neo-hippie charm wore off , leaving most people wondering what she was trying to say . one of those wondering where she was going was woodley herself , who wrapped up her speech by admitting it had totally gotten away from her . zac efron and dave franco : was the punchline for their whole shtick really just efron grabbing franco 's balls ? yes . apparently , a man touching another man 's junk is still comedy gold in 2015 . dwayne johnson : the rock shouting into the camera about 2014 's movie highlights was totally unnecessary . at this point , mtv has to realize we 've heard jokes about `` american sniper '' , `` gone girl '' , `` boyhood '' and `` whiplash '' for almost a year now , and we 're all ready to move on . but god bless the rock for giving it his all .",

    "article": "washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- isis is a problem that is `` off the charts historically '' and has sent the united states into `` uncharted territory '' when it comes to putting down the terror group , the obama administration 's point man in the fight recently told cnn . the comments , which brett mcgurk made in an exclusive interview , were some of the administration 's strongest to date in describing the challenge the united states and its allies face in battling isis . `` this is a problem that is off the charts historically , '' he said , referring to the more than 20,000 foreign fighters who have gone into syria . `` just put that into perspective : it 's about twice the number that went into afghanistan in the 1980s over a 10-year period to fight the soviet union , and those came really from only a handful of countries . '' he concluded , `` we 're in unchartered territory here . '' mcgurk just returned from an urgent summit of coalition nations held in jordan . last week , canada became the latest nation to conduct airstrikes against isis over syria . the united states now lists 62 countries in the coalition . as the u.s.-led coalition has focused attention on iraq and syria , isis has expanded its reach to libya , egypt and yemen , often with existing extremist groups pledging allegiance to the militants . mcgurk did not rule out expanding u.s. military action beyond iraq and syria to combat the increasing regional threat . `` we have a lot of tools to protect ourselves and our national security interests , some of which are military tools , '' he said . `` of course we apply those tools when the president determines and our chain of command makes the recommendation that that is the right thing to do . '' the united states has also been stepping up efforts to involve sunni groups in the fight against isis . to date , that involvement has been extremely limited as sunni tribes see shiite militias , many with horrendous human rights records , take the lead . but mcgurk said that iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi is making progress getting sunni tribes to support a planned iraqi offensive against isis in anbar province in the coming weeks . he stressed the importance of working with al-abadi , noting that the iraqi leader was in anbar province last week handing out more than 1,000 ak-47s to tribal fighters who are going to join the iraqi security forces . `` we are helping to enable and train -lrb- them -rrb- as they begin to go on the offensive over the coming weeks and months in anbar , '' mcgurk said . `` they put out this very perverse , twisted vision , and it 's very attractive to a lot of young men around the world , '' he acknowledged . `` but in fact , what the foreign fighters are finding in syria and iraq is that they 're more likely to get killed in iraq and syria , and in fact , instead of getting a slave bride as isis leaders promise them , they 're more likely to get killed by a female peshmerga fighter in the streets of kobani . '' that bottom line , he assessed , could turn the tide : `` the foreign fighters are learning the reality of what it 's like when they go to join this twisted version of a caliphate , and i think we 're going to see those networks begin to dry up .

'' sandretto said she first visited cuba three years ago and was instantly hooked . `` i stayed and went back and back because it 's a very unique place and people are really beautiful and amazing and with interesting stories , '' she said . gaining entrance to the maze-like solares was a constant negotiation , sandretto said , and plenty of times she was turned away . `` i always try to explain what i do , why i am there , why i am interested in where they live , the aim of my project , '' she said . toting a 30-year-old hasselblad 500cm camera , sandretto found it was a good way to strike up a conversation with her subjects . social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . `` they get curious when see someone going around with a bulky old camera , '' she said . `` i talk a lot . i am italian . i speak spanish , which helps but not a lot because you have to speak ` cuban , ' which is another language . '' her persistence allowed her to capture intimate moments of cubans resting in the sweltering heat , crowding around a communal tv or just going about life despite their disintegrating surroundings . there are no modern appliances or conveniences in her photographs . the people in these solares are n't the fortunate cubans who have relatives visiting from miami with flat-screens and smartphones in tow . instead , there is the sense of time being whittled away -- one game of dominoes or one tv soap opera a time . sandretto said she hopes to continue to document the changes on the island that occur as the united states and cuba work to restore diplomatic relations and an inevitable influx of american visitors arrive . the thawing in relations could even change life in cuba 's solares . `` people want to travel , have access to the internet and improve their economic situation , '' she said . `` i hope that 's what happens . '' carolina sandretto is an italian photographer based in new york . you can follow her on twitter .",

'' `` people listen to him , '' flack said . `` he is a monarch . the zulu people in south africa take him very seriously , they do n't question what he says . '' flack said he was motivated to make the allegations after seeing multiple complaints about xenophobic violence on social media and thinking they were n't enough . so he filed a complaint with the south african human rights commission , and then tweeted about it . `` the activists sit around feeling accomplished because they retweeted five times , '' flack said . `` i want to reach people who see that they can lay a charge and it wo n't cost them anything , but i will have done something to change the country and push it into a better state of being . '' now , the human rights commission must decide whether to investigate flack 's allegations against the king , who denies fueling any violence . flack hopes others will also make complaints . flack added that zulus are n't the only people in south africa who share in the xenophobic sentiment . `` people are frustrated and unemployed , and people in south africa pay foreign nationals a lot less , '' he said of the tension between nationals and immigrants . `` a domestic worker would ask for 250 rand a day to clean a house , whereas a foreign national would ask for 150 rand , so it causes resentment .

'' he said south africans also have been going to the camps , which are on sports fields with makeshift tents , bringing cooked food and other necessities . `` this is different from what happened in 2008 , '' sooliman said . that year , scores were killed in attacks in the poorest areas of johannesburg . most of the victims were zimbabweans who had fled repression and dire economic circumstances . sooliman said that along with the government strongly condemning the violence , community engagement is happening now as it never happened before . it is a kind of national unity that can be best summed up with another hashtag that has emerged from this story : #weareafrica . only time , or , tweets will tell if it works .",

'' but rather than ignore it because it 's a glossy , blockbuster action film , some might argue that the movie goes against type for academy award nominated films because the cast is so diverse . `` furious 7 '' hits theaters friday , months after controversy was stirred about the lack of diversity at the oscars . there were no actors of color nominated and no women in the directing category , which was dominated by white males . mexican filmmaker alejandro gonzalez i\u00f1arritu went on to win best director for `` birdman . '' the lack of diversity was so glaring -lrb- even with the mostly black cast of the movie `` selma , '' which received a nomination for best picture -rrb- that it spurred the twitter hashtag '' #oscarssowhite . '' in contrast , `` furious 7 '' could n't be more racially and ethnically inclusive . the cast includes dwayne `` the rock '' johnson -- a samoan/black man -- black actors christopher `` ludacris '' bridges and tyrese gibson , hispanic performer michelle rodriguez , thai martial artist tony jaa , beninese expatriate djimon hounsou and the late paul walker , a blue-eyed , blond-haired california native . the filmmakers even went so far as to make sure casting directors in abu dhabi and dubai , where key scenes were filmed , found diverse extras . `` we were mainly looking for the diverse look of the -lrb- united arab emirates -rrb- , '' miranda davidson , owner of the casting company , told the national . `` they really wanted to make sure we reflected the international feel of the country .

'' `` they 're loud , ludicrous , and visually incoherent , '' he said . `` they 're also the last bunch of movies you 'd expect to see in the same sentence as ` incredibly important .

'' the fact that they are alive truly make them miracle children . looking into those bright young faces , touching their pristine hands , the logic of our humanitarian mandate -- the mission to protect -- never felt stronger to me . like the wider syrian conflict , yarmouk has a human face ; the faces of young mohammad and young jihad . i want to introduce you to them in the hope that you , too , will understand why i am firmly convinced that turning away is not an option -- and why the international community must act in a concerted manner to respond to the many tragedies in syria . jihad ya ` qoub , the youngest palestinian refugee to flee yarmouk , was born on march 30 . his mother , said fatima , never imagined bringing a child into this world could be so tough . `` i was hoping to drink milk and eat eggs during my pregnancy , but our financial situation did allow us to buy these expensive food items , '' she said . said fatima was living in a community where the average person survived on just 400 calories a day . mohammad was born in yarmouk on january 25 of this year . when isis -- islamic state of iraq and syria -- entered the camp and tensions heightened , his mother , nadia , fled in search of safety . her only thoughts were to save the life of her newborn son . yet she has not lost hope in the possibility of a dignified future . she hopes that if and when life returns to normal , she will be able to live once more with her husband and son in the family home in yarmouk . these tales of courage and human dignity are a lesson for us all . when i next brief the security council , as i did a few days ago , i will tell them about jihad and mohammad . i will continue to press the case for humanitarian access to other children like them inside yarmouk , other civilians who need help where they are . to do this , hostilities will have to subside . pressure must be exerted on armed actors in yarmouk to this end . beyond that , those civilians wishing to temporarily leave must be allowed to do so safely . these things are all possible . but it takes the necessary political will -- nothing more , nothing less . yarmouk must be a place where the politics of the possible begin to take hold . i believe they can . because to abandon such belief would be to abandon jihad , mohammad and thousands of other civilians like them . and that is simply not an option .",

    "article": "garissa , kenya -lrb- cnn -rrb- the desks of the small madrassa are empty . its 573 students , all male , are staying home after kenyan president uhuru kenyatta announced three days of national mourning following last week 's deadly attack at a nearby university . only a few kilometers away , 147 people -- mostly students -- were brutally massacred when al-shabaab militants invaded the campus in garissa , a town in northeastern kenya . we 've come to this particular islamic religious school because the man suspected by kenyan authorities of being the `` mastermind '' behind the atrocity -- mohamed mohamud -- once taught here . `` he was someone who was very quiet , he did n't like too much talk , '' recalls sheikh khalif abdi hussein , the principal at the madrassa . he says he also taught with mohamud for two years . `` when he left the madrassa , he joined al-shabaab . but before , he was normal , just like me and other people . '' what worries authorities here is exactly that -- mohamud was kenyan . but now , say officials , mohamud is in command of an al-shabaab militia based near kenya 's long , porous border with somalia -- about 118 miles -lrb- 190km -rrb- from garissa -- who are believed to be responsible for numerous cross-border attacks into kenya . the islamist militant group , who are allied with al qaeda , have been waging a bloody campaign for control of somalia . with kenyan troops part of an african union force deployed in support of somalia 's united nations-supported government , kenya has now become a target . last year , an attack by al-shabaab on a shopping center in the country 's capital , nairobi , claimed the lives of 68 people . now mohamud stands accused of being behind thursday 's attack -- the deadliest attack in the nation since al qaeda killed more than 200 people at the u.s. embassy in nairobi in 1998 . but mohamud is not kenya 's only homegrown terrorist . the kenyan interior ministry has said at least one of the four gunmen who carried out the attack on the university was also kenyan . abdirahim abdullahi was in his 20s and the son of a government chief . his father says he lost contact with his son in 2013 , shortly after he left university . the kenyan government is concerned that al-shabaab is recruiting disaffected youth from inside the country . `` our task of countering terrorism has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities , '' president kenyatta said during an address to the nation in the aftermath of the massacre . meanwhile , sheikh khalif insists his madrassa has nothing to do with mohamud 's extreme , violent ideas . `` this man is a dangerous man , a killer , a criminal , '' he says . but he was also once a neighbor . and so kenyans must now look within to tackle this very real threat to the country 's -- and the region 's -- stability .",

    "article": "-lrb- the hollywood reporter -rrb- it may be time to light the lights . abc is filming a proof of concept for a revival of `` the muppets , '' the hollywood reporter has learned . `` the big bang theory '' co-creator bill prady is co-writing the script for a pilot presentation that sources say could be unspooled at may 's upfront presentation to madison avenue advertisers . sources tell thr that the project , if all goes well , could go straight to series . bob kushell -lrb- `` anger management , '' `` 3rd rock from the sun '' -rrb- will also co-write and is attached to serve as showrunner , with wilfred 's randall einhorn attached to exec produce and direct the presentation . abc 's `` muppets '' revival is being produced by abc studios and the muppet studios , which disney owns . the presentation is set to film next weekend on the disney lot in burbank with some of the original muppet performers returning . sources say the concept for the presentation includes the regular cast of characters created by jim henson -- kermit the frog , fozzie bear , gonzo and animal , among others -- gathering at abc studios for a meeting about the new `` muppet show . '' however , the show wo n't move forward unless miss piggy signs on , and her current relationship with frequent love kermit is on the rocks , preventing the show from getting off the ground . early plans call for two celebrity cameos -- including miss piggy 's current co-star -- as well as new roles including fozzie 's girlfriend and her parents . for prady , the revived `` muppets '' -- which landed at abc after initial interest from netflix -- marks a return to his roots . the producer , who currently does not have an overall deal , started his career working for henson in 1982 and ultimately started writing for `` the jim henson hour , '' remaining on the series until a year after henson 's death in 1990 . this marks the second time prady has attempted to revive `` the muppets . '' the writer-producer shot some test footage before cbs ' `` the big bang theory '' that disney ultimately passed on . for his part , prady earned an emmy nomination in 1991 for writing tribute `` the muppets celebrate jim henson '' in 1990 and has contributed writing to disney 's muppet-themed attractions . should abc order `` muppets '' to series , prady would juggle both that project and cbs ' `` the big bang theory , '' which he exec produces . created in 1955 by henson , the original muppet characters appeared on `` sam and friends '' from 1955-61 before going on to appear on late-night talk shows and commercials and becoming a regular part of `` sesame street '' in 1969 . `` the muppet show '' launched on its own as a comedy-variety series and ran from 1976-81 , with kermit serving as the de-facto showrunner on the syndicated series that was produced out of the u.k. . the franchise has spawned multiple movies -lrb- 1979 's `` the muppet movie , '' 1981 's `` the great muppet caper , '' 1984 's `` the muppets take manhattan '' -rrb- as well as nbc 's 1989 series `` the jim henson hour . '' following henson 's death , the franchise continued with `` muppets tonight '' airing on abc in 1996 with reruns airing on sibling disney channel from 1997-2000 . that was the last television series to feature the muppets characters . on the feature side , the franchise featured 1992 's `` the muppet christmas carol , '' 1996 's `` muppet treasure island '' and 1999 's `` muppets from space , '' the latter two of which were co-produced by disney , who acquired rights to the muppets in 2004 and formed the muppets studio . the company rebranded the franchise in 2008 with jason segel 's `` the muppets , '' with an eighth feature in the franchise , `` muppets most wanted '' bowing in 2014 . for abc , the muppets revival comes as variety shows are in the midst of a resurgence on the broadcast networks . nbc has made the format a priority , unspooling marlon wayans-hosted celebrity variety series `` i can do that ! '' in the summer and has neil patrick harris entry `` saturday night takeaway '' in the works . the decision to revive `` the muppets '' also comes as remakes and reboots are having their moment in the sun on the small-screen , as broadcast networks look to fan bases for existing franchises to help cut through the clutter and draw eyeballs in an increasingly crowded scripted space . on the comedy side , `` the muppets '' arrives as it has become increasingly challenging to launch original scripted half-hours . prady is repped by rothman brecher and lichter grossman ; kushell is with icm partners ; einhorn is with wme , odenkirk provissiero and bloom hergott . \u00a9 2015 the hollywood reporter . all rights reserved .",

'' the actual number of children who were kidnapped and killed did not change -- it 's always been a relatively small number -- but awareness of the cases skyrocketed , experts said . but the news industry was expanding to cable television , and sweet images of children appeared along with destroyed parents begging for their safe return . the fear rising across the nation sparked awareness and prompted change from politicians and police . in 1984 , congress passed the missing children 's assistance act , which led to the creation of the national center for missing & exploited children . former president ronald reagan opened the center in a white house ceremony in 1984 . it soon began operating a 24-hour toll-free hot line on which callers could report information about missing boys and girls . joe sterling and cnn 's lorenzo ferrigno contributed to this report .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- the public outrage over the `` religious freedom '' bills recently passed in arkansas and indiana caught the governors of those states completely off-guard , judging by their confused and contradictory responses . as poll watchers , they surely knew that most americans now oppose the discriminatory laws and practices they accepted as normal only a dozen years ago . but the politicians underestimated the pushback organized by local and national businesses , including companies with no previous record of public support for social equality . they had better adjust to a new reality . for the past three decades , socially conservative evangelicals and pro-business interests have been powerfully allied against government regulations , environmental initiatives and social welfare programs , while supporting lower taxes for the wealthy and pushing back against the growing diversity in america 's population . for many , this alliance been puzzling : other , equally devout christians who place more emphasis on jesus christ 's message of unconditional love and on his denunciations of excessive wealth and neglect of the poor , have been uncomfortable with it , as have many business leaders . their priorities , after all , are based on the bottom line . and companies that sell goods and services to the public are learning that support for discrimination -- or even passive acceptance of it -- threatens that bottom line . hence , after indiana gov. mike pence signed a law that opened a new door for discrimination against same-sex couples , the threat of boycotts and other retaliation was swift , from groups as diverse as the national collegiate athletic association , the indiana pacers , walmart , eli lilly , apple and even the marriott international hotel chain . marriott international was founded by j.w. marriott , a dedicated mormon , and is now run by his son bill , also a mormon who fully accepts his church 's teachings about traditional marriage . yet in june , marriott international launched a '' #love travels '' marketing campaign , aimed at attracting lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender travelers with an assurance of `` the company 's commitment to make everyone feel comfortable about who they are . '' asked about the discrepancy between his religious rejection of same-sex marriage and his marketing overtures to same-sex honeymooners , marriott pointed to the bible 's injunction of unconditional love , but added `` beyond that , i am very careful about separating my personal faith and beliefs from how we run our business . '' in 2014 , global spending by lgbt travelers was estimated at more than $ 200 billion , and spending by this market segment is rising much faster than overall spending on travel . so marriott worries when states start to make such travelers feel unwelcome . businesses seeking to develop brand loyalty among younger consumers have a special incentive to highlight their rejection of anti-gay bias . a cnn poll taken in february found that 72 % of millennials nationwide believe that same-sex couples have the right to have their marriages recognized as valid . even among white evangelical protestants , 43 % of millennials support same-sex marriage , compared with less than 20 % of those their grandparents ' age , 68 and older . it used to be that businesses could close their eyes to discrimination in areas geographically isolated from the more liberal coasts , but that is no longer possible . according to researchers for mtv 's `` look different '' anti-bias campaign , 90 % of youths aged 14 to 24 agree that it is important to make their communities a less biased place , and almost 80 % say that everyone has a responsibility to help tackle bias . so who 's the `` moral majority '' now ? for media-savvy millennials , following that moral imperative means spreading the news about discrimination wherever it occurs and reaching beyond geographic boundaries to mobilize against it . in the first 24 hours after arkansas passed its version of the `` religious freedom '' bill , the twitter hashtag #boycottarkansas was used 12,000 times . it then snowballed after celebrity blogger perez hilton tweeted it to his 5.9 million twitter followers . america has crossed a threshold where it is no longer a good business model or political strategy to be intolerant of diversity , whether that pertains to race , ethnicity , gender or sexual orientation . since 2011 , the majority of children that have been born in the united states each year are members of racial or ethnic minorities . hispanics are projected to account for most of the growth in the labor force between now and 2060 . women now lead men in educational attainment . and more than half of americans live in states where same-sex marriage is legal . business leaders and politicians who ignore or offend these constituencies do so at their own peril .",

'' dumig met sahra through a photo workshop at refugio , a shelter in munich , germany , for refugees and torture victims . what drew dumig to sahra specifically was her strength and her ability to effectively reflect on all of her experiences . `` it really impressed me how she deals with everything , '' dumig said . `` she 's strong in her way of connecting with the culture here and also reflecting on what happened , the culture where she comes from . '' the number of refugees seeking asylum in the european union increased by 25 % last year , with germany receiving the most applications . one of the reasons dumig decided to photograph sahra is because growing up in germany made dumig realize that she lived a fortunate lifestyle . another reason has to do with dumig 's interest in people 's emotions and finding one 's identity . `` i realized so many people want to come to europe , and i always had the feeling to disappear or to go away , '' dumig said . `` seeing how people live in other parts of the world made me realize how privileged i am . '' `` apart together '' serves not only as a documentation of sahra , but as a far-reaching story about people from all backgrounds . the title of dumig 's work refers to the fact that although people may be physically apart from one another , the comparable feelings they experience are what link all people together . `` sometimes we feel strong , sometimes we feel lost -- that 's kind of universal , i think , '' dumig said . `` that 's why i want to universalize -lrb- sahra 's -rrb- story as well , not only make it about her . '' the underlying themes of `` apart together '' include the feelings of isolation and `` otherness '' and the search for a valuable human dignity . social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . `` every one of these -lrb- refugees -rrb- have strong stories , and in the bureaucratic system , they are just a number or a document , '' dumig said . `` but they are a person , they are people with emotions and lives . '' sahra is currently under the status of `` suspension of deportation , '' meaning german immigration officials may grant her discretionary relief from deportation . dumig describes sahra as someone living through an unresolved situation . regardless of the challenges sahra faces as a refugee in germany , she is a survivor and the embodiment of resilience , determined to establish a new life for herself . she has learned to speak german fluently , and she has started working in the nation as well . like an unsolved photographic puzzle , each photo within `` apart together '' provides a piece of insight into sahra 's experiences . there is no certain and clear way in which to arrange the pieces , because they are a representation of the fragmented nature of sahra 's life . many of dumig 's photos are not of sahra herself , but instead show her surroundings . this makes `` apart together '' rich in symbolism and challenges viewers to develop their own perceptions . the photos are powerful because of this symbolic nature , as there are infinite interpretations attached to each one . `` i think everyone interprets by themselves , by however way they perceive it through their own experience . that 's up to the viewer , '' dumig said . `` it depends on who looks at the pictures . ... everyone will see something different . '' `` apart together '' allowed dumig to share various special moments with sahra , and they were both able to learn from each other . `` it was just something we both got something out of , '' dumig said . ines dumig is a photographer based in germany .",

'' the dancer did not pursue a case against the bolshoi . when she left the bolshoi in 2013 , womack joined the kremlin ballet theatre where she still works , aged 20 , as a principal ballerina ; dancing close to the russian president 's office , next to the cathedrals inside the red walls of the kremlin . the surroundings may be opulent but her pay packet is not : for her role as a principal dancer womack says she is paid around $ 240 a month -- which works out at around $ 8 a day . the dancer says the amount of money she makes in dollars each month has fallen as the russian ruble has weakened -- the currency has suffered , in part , from a low oil price and international sanctions imposed on russia over its annexation of crimea last year . womack says a friend helps her with accommodation and she says she has to make the money stretch in order to buy food . `` for anyone paid a salary in rubles , especially since the crisis , it is extremely difficult . you have to decide what is worth more for you - experience or financial stability . i 'm at a point in my life where experience is worth more . '' sitting in the wings of the stage , chatting in russian to the other dancers and stretching before her rehearsal for swan lake , she says she has to make the $ 185 in her bank account last for the next few weeks . to earn extra money she dances bigger roles or takes part in events abroad . the kremlin ballet theatre says womack 's salary corresponds to her job title as a principal dancer and that , `` on average , the salary -lsb- principal -rsb- dancers are paid is significantly higher '' than $ 240 a month but that womack could have been paid that equivalent in dollars `` depending on the exchange rate on the day and depending on how much she danced in productions the previous month . '' as an american , womack says she is paid the same as her contemporaries and is treated just like the russians . but she says that is not always the case offstage . `` it 's extremely difficult to watch the deteriorating relationships between the united states and russia . the great thing about working for a russian company is that we are focused on creating art but ... outside the ballet world it is difficult for foreigners ; the general tendency tends to be more nationalistic and they unfortunately judge foreigners by their cover . '' although relations between the u.s. and russia have taken a nosedive since russia 's annexation of crimea last march , womack says she is `` very loyal '' to the kremlin ballet theatre . `` i love the russian system and i 'm very patriotic in that sense , '' she says . and despite the political situation -- and the money -- she says , `` russia has a lot to offer , it is a beautiful place that creates stars and that itself is worth investing one 's career in .",

'' luxury brands tend to enter country markets through distributors , benefiting from local knowledge of their partners but still retaining a significant amount of control over how their name is marketed in that country . `` getting a new brand in a new market where they do n't fully understand the operating environment would be very dangerous for that brand , '' explains roberts . she warns that in spite of potential , the future of luxury in africa is dependent on reforms taking place : `` it will rely on infrastructure and the operating environment such as security and how trading is done , '' she says . when it comes to what they choose to splash their cash on , africa 's rich like to stick to well-known global labels that carry an automatic badge of status . `` generally the brands they buy will be more ostentatious compared to somebody in the more developed , mature markets . it 's going to be the louis vuitton , the gucci , the prada , '' says roberts . she adds that this could be down to the fact that typical a luxury consumer in africa is much younger than those in mature markets such as western europe , who tend to be in their 50s and 60s . `` they are in their late twenties or thirties so it 's very much new wealth , and they will be looking towards luxury as a means of showing status and success , '' says roberts . however , in spite of mainstream brand 's dominance , smaller home-grown labels also see the growth in appetite for luxury goods as a valuable opportunity . `` africa has all the foundations that are needed to create a real vibrant luxury industry , '' says swaady martin leke , ivorian entrepreneur and founder of the johannesburg-based luxury tea brand yswara . `` we have the craftsmanship , we have the heritage , we have a very rich culture that does n't date just 20 years , but centuries , thousands and thousands of years of know-how and craftsmanship . so here is this continent where you have all the raw material and the know-how , but what is missing is the link to luxury . `` now is the time and you need to start positioning yourself , because africa is getting richer , that 's for sure , '' she adds . more from africa view . read this : ethiopia - a land where coffee meets tradition . read this : why kenya is the flower garden of europe .",

'' the lawsuit alleges the rockefeller foundation funded johns hopkins ' research into public health issues , including venereal disease , and employed scientists who monitored the guatemala experiments . the lawsuit , the rockefeller foundation statement said , `` seeks improperly to assign ` guilt by association ' in the absence of compensation from the united states federal government . '' the suit says johns hopkins and the rockefeller foundation designed , supported and benefited from the guatemala experiments . bristol-myers squibb pharmaceutical group and that company 's owner , mead johnson , also are defendants . the pharmaceutical company supplied drugs for the experiments , the suit says . on saturday , a spokeswoman for bristol-myers squibb sent this statement to cnn : `` we 've only just received the complaint in this matter . bristol-myers squibb played an important role in the development of penicillin in the past and today we continue to focus our work on developing breakthrough medicines for serious disease . as a company dedicated to patients , we take this matter very seriously and are reviewing the allegations . '' nobody doubts the experiments happened . in 2010 , then-secretary of state hillary clinton apologized to guatemala for the experiments , saying they were `` clearly unethical . '' in the 1930s and 1940s , the government followed a policy of funding scientific medical research but not controlling individual doctors , the suit says . the lawsuit says john hopkins controlled and influenced the appointed panels that authorized funding for research into venereal disease . the lawsuit says prostitutes were infected to intentionally spread the disease and that syphilis spirochetes were injected into the spinal fluid of subjects . a woman in a psychiatric hospital had gonorrhea pus from a male subject injected into both her eyes , the suit says . the lawsuit does n't say why the experiments ended . the results were never published and were not revealed until 2011 , when the presidential commission for the study of bioethical issues wrote a letter to president barack obama telling of its investigation , the suit says . cnn 's deanna hackney contributed to this report .",

'' bentley began collecting them six years ago after a note caught her eye one rainy night on a walk in her home town of norwich , england . it 's something she confesses has been a lifelong love -- keepsakes ranging from her mother 's cutlery to her own dead goldfish have ended up carefully preserved in her collection for posterity . the notes project , she says , is a culmination of keeping her eyes on the sidewalk and spotting the little things that most people would n't notice as they walked down the street . `` i get very odd looks from strangers , '' she admits , `` but since i 've made friends and families aware of the project , they get very excited when i find one while out with them . '' and while some dismiss such behavior as hoarding , bentley feels it is part of human nature to hold on to items , no matter how small or insignificant they may seem . `` humans want to collect and show to others , '' she says . `` they want to share and learn from the things they have found . '' she says her collecting has led to interesting anthropological insights into the human condition . one of her favorite observations is the evolution of handwriting over the past few decades , from the beautiful copperplate penmanship of the '70s to modern teen girl love notes with hearts dotting i 's and multiple exclamation marks . more recently , the note collection has led to an exhibition at stour space gallery in london 's hackney wick , where bentley works as a shop and studio manager . it showcases a small part of her 1,500-strong collection . the decision to display the notes came in part from a desire to put them back into the public space . `` i always wanted to showcase them , to see what people 's reactions were and if anyone would come forward , '' she said . so far two note owners -- one a colleague from the gallery and one an employee from a pub whose beer coasters she had found on her quest -- have revealed themselves as owners of notes . bentley gave them framed prints as a thank you . and while some may find the notion of handwritten notes quaint , as social media and smartphones begin to replace handwriting , bentley says she finds the note collection an interesting way for an artist to explore people 's lives . `` technology is useful , but sometimes the simplest ways are still the best , '' she said . `` i still usually draw a map rather than relying on technology to get to a place -- and many people are just the same .

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- five years after the deepwater horizon rig exploded and unleashed the largest marine oil spill in the nation 's history , we are still experiencing -- yet only beginning to truly understand -- its profound environmental and economic repercussions . the immediate aftermath of the oil spill has been well documented , with declines in tourism and the seafood industry , as well as the significant destruction of wildlife in the region . since then , the amount of oil in the area has dissipated and communities have started to show signs of recovery . in fact , reports indicate that the gulf of mexico 's seafood industry , which supplies the united states with roughly 40 % of its seafood , is finally starting to rebound . however , profound challenges remain , in part because so many questions about the long-term consequences remain unanswered . to this day , it 's still unclear where all of the oil went , exactly how much remains or whether the reappearance of wildlife is a result of adaptation or a signal that the crisis is truly abating . one of the populations that can provide insight into these questions is the gulf crab . crabs play an important role in the region : roughly 60 million pounds were fished in the gulf in 2012 , earning tens of millions in revenue . yet in the aftermath of the spill , changes to crustacean communities in the area were quite apparent to the naked eye . researchers documented substantial differences in appearance , and deformities in crabs that were affected by the spill including lesions so numerous they ate through the joints , forcing limbs to fall off . these traits have affected not only the crabs ' market value but also likely their ability to survive . while these changes in outward appearance have dissipated in the short-term , the health of these crabs could still be precarious . i have been working with colleagues at florida international university and university of louisiana at lafayette to better understand what might be happening biologically inside the crab when it is exposed to oil and the dispersant used to respond to the spill . using the power of genomics and computational biology , we analyzed the genes of flat back mud crabs that were exposed to oil from the macondo prospect where the deepwater horizon rig was drilling when it exploded or to a combination of oil and dispersant in the lab . by studying gene expression , the process that turns information from a gene into a product that functions within a cell , we searched for indicators that might signal exposure to oil and , based on the types of changes we might see , clues as to how the crabs respond . although we are still in the early stages of our research , we are seeing significant differences in gene expression connected to exposure -- meaning the crabs are turning some genes on or off in response to oil and dispersant . we are still working to determine whether these changes impact their ability to survive and reproduce . it 's not just gulf crabs that are experiencing changes . research on different species and other aspects of the regional environment is starting to show that there could be long-term effects resulting from the oil spill and the response to the spill . this not only has consequences for the gulf area , where oil drilling continues , but also for communities along the atlantic coast , where the obama administration has recently announced a plan to open unprecedented oil and natural gas exploration . -lrb- bp 's vice president of communications , geoff morrell , told cnn that wildlife species in the gulf have `` bounced back and `` there is no data that suggests there are any long-term population-level impacts to any species . '' -rrb- . with the virtual certainty of more spills , we need a lot more information on the consequences of these disasters and how we can combat them effectively and efficiently . the u.s. department of the interior and the environmental protection agency are making some progress . in coming months , they are releasing changes to regulations and response plans based on the early lessons learned from the deepwater horizon spill . but government agencies can not just rely on the short-term data to determine the best response for the next oil spill crisis . instead , the government and oil companies should work together to support ongoing , long-term ecological research so that we have a better grasp of what `` normal '' looks like and what factors are important in maintaining those conditions even after a disastrous oil spill . only then will we truly understand the impact of offshore drilling and the best ways to respond to crises to protect our most important natural resources .",

'' he called being inducted by wonder , `` a lion holding the door for a kitty cat . '' the moment of relative levity was welcome after moving tributes paid to the late lou reed by patti smith and reed 's widow , music artist laurie anderson , who shared the three rules for life that they came up with : `` one : do n't be afraid of anyone ; two : get a really good b ------ t detector and learn how to use it ; three : be really , really tender . '' smith had to push back tears on at least three occasions . she recalled a night when they wound up in the same hotel and reed invited her up . she found him in the tub dressed in black and she sat on the toilet and talked with him . green day was inducted by fall out boy , who referenced the length of some of the speeches . cracked fall out boy frontman patrick stump : `` i feel like i 'm in a line at the dmv .

'' in the case of this specific hummus recall , while there was no evidence that it caused any consumer illness , the product 's routine sample last month revealed the presence of listeria monocytogenes . consuming such bacteria can lead to listeriosis , a serious infection , and dr. swartzberg recommends that anyone who has consumed a listeria-laden food should let their physician know as soon as possible . `` listeria survives well at cool temperatures , '' he said . `` most bacteria and fungi do not -- that 's why we refrigerate . healthy people are at low risk for disease , but it can happen . those at greatest risk for disease are the elderly , immunocompromised and pregnant .

'' drew plenty of attention on social media . some commentators focused on abbott 's drinking technique . but others suggested he was setting a bad example . abbott had attacked binge drinking as recently as last year . `` like most australians , i enjoy a drink on social occasions , '' he said in january 2014 . `` however , as a father and as a citizen , i 'm appalled by the violent binge drinking culture that now seems so prevalent , especially at `` hot spots '' in our big cities . '' casting those concerns aside , some social media users belittled abbott 's beer swilling . they said his effort was a pale imitation of the legendary drinking exploits of former prime minister bob hawke , who is credited with drinking two and a half pints in 11 seconds .",

'' farage -- who is on the campaign trail ahead of britain 's general elections on may 7 -- said he did not intend to cross swords with the prince . `` it is an impressive sword . i do n't have one but i 'm sure we could find one if we had to . but i 'm not intending to accept the offer , '' a spokesman quoted him as saying . `` i would have thought that a polish prince with a long polish lineage would rather agree with me that it 's a complete tragedy for poland that it 's lost so many of its brightest and best young people . '' ukip wants britain to leave the european union . it says it would not seek to remain a party to the region 's free trade or economic treaties `` while those treaties maintain a principle of free movement of labor , which prevents the uk managing its own borders . '' it has also pledged to cut the country 's # 9 billion -lrb- $ 12.4 b -rrb- annual foreign aid budget . another ukip politician appeared to back his party leader 's chances in a duel , tweeting an image of a medieval knight sliced in two , with the comment : `` this is what nigel would do to him . '' but there was no word on whether farage would even accept the prince 's less life-threatening back-up challenge . `` alternatively , if you do n't agree or if your sword is a little bit rusty , mr. farage , we can meet for a different kind of duel -- a duel with words in a tv studio in the run-up to the elections , '' zylinski suggested . `` i 'm up for it , it would be really nice , hopefully you will agree . '' zylinski posted a separate video on youtube entitled `` 7 reasons why the british should love the poles , '' in which he pointed to a times newspaper headline from march reading : `` we need more migrants ... they are the best workers in britain . '' the headline , he said , applied `` principally '' to the poles . `` what i can not accept is the amount of hostility and in some cases hatred towards the poles . enough is enough , i say , this has got to stop . '' zylinski pointed to polish contributions to britain including those made by polish raf pilots during the battle of britain , what he said was a `` wonderful work ethic '' and easy integration into the community . `` we are often more loyal to britain than many british people i know , '' he said . `` we are very grateful to be here . we would like you to be grateful too . please stop knocking the poles . we love this country we would like british to love us too .

'' epstein 's son , david epstein , was acquitted on tuesday of kidnapping charges . the jury returned not guilty verdicts on the attempted kidnapping charges against mendel epstein , and on more severe kidnapping charges against the three rabbis . nine other individuals previously pled guilty in the case to conspiracy charges , according to a press release from the u.s. attorney 's office in new jersey . henry mazurek , the lawyer for david epstein , said his client was grateful for the jury 's decision but called his client 's acquittals `` bittersweet '' next to his father 's conviction . `` he really believes that -lrb- his father -rrb- was a champion of someone who was voiceless in his religion , '' mazurek said . sentencing is set for july 15 . the men face up to life in prison .",

'' the sculpture , a gift to the town from its original owners , has been on display since 2009 . artist dave poulin has `` had plenty of opportunity to step forward , and our last conversation he wanted $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 , '' celoron mayor scott schrecengost said . `` and then he stated that if we did n't have the funds and we did n't like the statue , we should take it down and put it in storage .

'' poulin said he has been talking to celoron officials for several years about removing and redoing the sculpture . it seems that cost has been the chief barrier . `` it puzzles me when an art work is donated to a community , they accept it , and then get angry and insist you redo the art work at your own expense . '' poulin wrote in the letter . but the recent media attention to the sculpture seems to have changed his mind . `` i am willing to put my time and money into redoing the lucy sculpture and feel confident after ten years i can do a much better job , '' poulin wrote . no thanks , schrecengost said . he said the town is looking for a new sculptor to fix the statue . `` it would be reworked from the shoulders up -- the entire head , neck and shoulders , not just the face , '' schrecengost said in a news release tuesday . the town has set up a post office box for donations , which can also be made through kickstarter . but the controversy may not be over . it seems that nearby jamestown , new york , also has ties to lucille ball 's early years and might be interested in its own tribute to the comedic legend . schrecengost 's tuesday statement referred to an anonymous facebook campaign that he claims is aimed at raising jamestown 's lucille ball profile at the expense of the celoron statue . `` the best place for a life size statue of lucy is right where it is now -- in lucille ball memorial park in her hometown , in the village of celoron , ny , '' he said . cnn 's emanuella grinberg contributed to this story .",

'' thus began a bloody vicious cycle , with al-shabaab retaliating on kenyan soil with ever more spectacular mass killings . here are some of the most heinous attacks on kenya by the somali terrorist group . early thursday , while many students still slept , at least four gunman burst into a christian prayer service at garissa university college , leading into easter weekend . they shot students and took hostages , whom they herded across campus . as they encountered students , they separated them into muslims and christians . they spared the former , eyewitness joel ayora said . they killed the latter . kenyan special forces moved in at the campus located about 90 miles from somalia 's southern border . they killed four gunman , but not before 147 victims were shot dead . in december , al-shabaab militants carried out the same macabre division of captives by religion at a rock quarry not far from the somali border . they shot christian workers dead , and spared their muslim colleagues . red cross workers counted at least 36 bodies dumped into the quarry . it was eye-for-an-eye retaliation , the militants said , for raids kenyan security forces carried out on mosques intended to weed out extremists . parallel to operation linda nchi , kenya has gone after ethnic somalis within their own borders triggering protest by human rights watch , which has accused the government of ethnic profiling and mistreatment . in a 2011 case , kenyan authorities reportedly rounded up ethnic somalis in garissa and let them sit in the mud , while beating some of them , hrw alleged . passengers on a bus in kenya 's north were told to recite from the quran or die in november 2014 . shortly after the bus carrying some 60 people departed mandera , near somalia 's border , al-shabaab gunmen stopped it in a hilly area and barged in . those who failed to recite verses were gunned down , leaving 28 dead . in its claim of responsibility , al-shabaab said the dead were christians , and their killing was retaliation mosque raids by kenyans . a day after the attack , kenyan security forces retaliated with an offensive across the border into somalia . they claimed to kill 100 al-shabaab militants . in july , al-shabaab gunmen opened fire on the lamu coast , a popular tourist region , and at a police station in a neighboring county . they killed 22 people . last may , tour companies evacuated vacationers from kenya after the uk and united states issued alerts that there was a high threat of attacks . before the garissa massacre , the westgate mall attack was the deepest wound al-shabaab had inflicted on kenya . for four days , four attackers turned the luxury shopping mall in the capital nairobi into a cauldron of blood , smoke and rubble . part of the mall collapsed as kenyan security forces fought for control . at least 61 civilians were killed , as well as a handful of security officers . al-shabaab said the attack was retaliation for kenya participation in africa union military operations in somalia . even with al-shabaab 's shooting in garissa , al qaeda 's bombing of the u.s. embassy in 1998 remains the single bloodiest islamist terror attack on kenyan soil . in short succession , bombs detonated at u.s. embassies in kenya and tanzania back then . the nairobi bombing was much deadlier that the explosion at dar es salaam . al qaeda founding member mamdouh mahmud salim was arrested and accused in the bombing and is being held in a new york jail , where he still awaits trial . he is serving a 32 year sentence after being convicted of stabbing a prison guard there in the eye .",

' '' the behavior carried on for a number of months and on several occasions , the post states . eventually the cafe 's manager made it clear to key that his actions were unwelcome . key , who regularly visits the auckland cafe with his wife , told reporters that his behavior was in the context of `` a bit of banter , '' but said that he had apologized when it was clear she had taken offense . the blog post says that the prime minister offered the offended waitress two bottles of his own jk 2012 pinot noir wine by way of apology . `` we have lots of fun and games there , there 's always lots of practical jokes and things . it 's a very warm and friendly relationship , '' he told reporters in los angeles en route to anzac day commemorations in gallipoli , turkey . `` but if you look at it now , no . when i realized she took offense by that i just sort of immediately went back , gave her some wine , apologized and said i was terribly sorry . '' politicians and public figures also rounded on key , with green mp metiria turei saying that the prime minister should be held to the same standards of behavior as the rest of the electorate . `` a lot of new zealanders know what it 's like to feel as if you 're not taken seriously in a job . as politicians , our job is to make people feel safe at work , not bullied , '' new zealand media reported her as saying . `` it 's a sign of how out of touch john key has become when he ca n't even monitor how inappropriate his personal behavior is , and when people are not comfortable with how he is behaving . '' jackie blue , head of the equal employment opportunities commission , echoed the sentiment . `` it 's never ok to touch someone without their permission , '' tvnz reported her as saying . `` there are no exceptions . '' political analyst bryce edwards told the network that the `` strangeness factor '' of the accusation would haunt key . `` a lot of people will be laughing at john key , that 's harder to recover from , '' he said in a segment . the national council of women of new zealand , while accepting that key was joking and did not mean to offend , criticized the premier . `` the fact that our prime minister has joined the list of people outed for sexism highlights how much sexism is a part of our culture . and it starts at the top , '' the organization 's chief executive sue mccabe wrote in an open letter . `` up and down this country , day after day , people are touched without giving their consent . at one end of the scale , it is an unwelcome pull on a ponytail . at the other end , it 's our shocking levels of violence against women .

'' an army air force veteran of world war ii , he studied architecture at the university of michigan and lawrence institute of technology near detroit , and worked for an architectural firm , but decided that drawing was n't the path to success . `` i wanted to build . '' in his autobiography , `` threshold resistance : the extraordinary career of a luxury retailing pioneer , '' taubman said that when he `` looked over the horizon , i saw that there was money to be made by people who could build and own stores or , better yet , groups of stores . '' he founded the taubman co. in 1950 and began to demonstrate what the company 's website calls an `` ability to assess and overcome threshold resistance -- a phrase he coined to describe the psychological and physical barriers that keep a shopper from entering a store . '' as the post-war growth of suburbia continued , retail developers like taubman began to consider what that might mean : more and more people needed places to shop . taubman embarked on multi-store developments in the 1950s , in places like flint and taylor , michigan , and in 1961 broke ground on his first large mall , the 350,000-square-foot arborland project in ann arbor . `` demographically , i looked at the numbers , and as far as i was concerned we could n't miss , '' he recalled in 2007 . `` and we did n't . '' indeed not . this year , forbes estimated his net worth at $ 3.1 billion , and the company 's u.s. malls generate average annual sales of $ 809 per square foot , according to the company 's website . but if alfred taubman gained fame and amassed billions as one of the people who helped define suburban life , he gained notoriety along the way , as well . in 1983 , he bought the renowned international auction house sotheby 's . and in 2002 he was jailed following a conviction for conspiring with rival auction house christie 's to fix auction house commission rates to maximize profits . he was released in 2003 after having served nine months in prison . he always maintained his innocence , saying one of his underlings had lied about him to keep from going to prison herself . taubman was renowned for his attention to detail , knowledge of design and for developing some of the best-known malls in the united states . he first project was a freestanding bridal shop in detroit . over more than six decades , his company operated nearly 20 properties in the continental u.s. , including well-known developments such as the beverly center in los angeles , the mall at short hills in new jersey and the shops at crystals , in las vegas . his designs evolved over the years to include not only enclosed malls but various styles of open-air developments . and his influence stretched far from the american soil and into the thriving markets of china and south korea . people we 've lost in 2015 . taubman remained active until the end of his life . he devoted much of his energy in his later years to philanthropic activities . and , just over three weeks before his death , he attended the grand opening of the mall of san juan in puerto rico with his sons robert and william . according to a statement by robert taubman , the patriarch had dinner in his home in bloomfield hills , michigan , on friday , then died of a heart attack . in addition to his sons , robert and william , he is survived by a daughter , gayle taubman kalisman , who is co-chair of the a. alfred taubman medical research institute 's advisory board , two stepchildren , and his second wife , judith mazor rounick , a former miss israel . cnn 's cameron tankersley contributed to this report .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- the mass killings of armenians in the ottoman empire , which began 100 years ago friday , is said by some scholars and others to have been the first genocide of the 20th century , even though the word `` genocide '' did not exist at the time . the issue of whether to call the killings a genocide is emotional , both for armenians , who are descended from those killed , and for turks , the heirs to the ottomans . for both groups , the question touches as much on national identity as on historical facts . some armenians feel their nationhood can not be fully recognized unless the truth of what happened to their forebears is acknowledged . some turks still view the armenians as having been a threat to the ottoman empire in a time of war , and say many people of various ethnicities -- including turks -- were killed in the chaos of war . in addition , some turkish leaders fear that acknowledgment of a genocide could lead to demands for huge reparations . so , what do we know about happened in those fateful days ? here are some answers : . the ottoman turks , having recently entered world war i on the side of germany and the austro-hungarian empire , were worried that armenians living in the ottoman empire would offer wartime assistance to russia . russia had long coveted control of constantinople -lrb- now istanbul -rrb- , which controlled access to the black sea -- and therefore access to russia 's only year-round seaports . many historians agree that the number was about 2 million . however , victims of the mass killings also included some of the 1.8 million armenians living in the caucasus under russian rule , some of whom were massacred by ottoman forces in 1918 as they marched through east armenia and azerbaijan . by 1914 , ottoman authorities were already portraying armenians as a threat to the empire 's security . then , on the night of april 23-24 , 1915 , the authorities in constantinople , the empire 's capital , rounded up about 250 armenian intellectuals and community leaders . many of them ended up deported or assassinated . april 24 , known as red sunday , is commemorated as genocide remembrance day by armenians around the world . friday is the 100th anniversary of that day . this is a major point of contention . estimates range from 300,000 to 2 million deaths between 1914 and 1923 , with not all of the victims in the ottoman empire . but most estimates -- including one of 800,000 between 1915 and 1918 , made by ottoman authorities themselves -- fall between 600,000 and 1.5 million . whether due to killings or forced deportation , the number of armenians living in turkey fell from 2 million in 1914 to under 400,000 by 1922 . almost any way one can imagine . while the death toll is in dispute , photographs from the era document some mass killings . some show ottoman soldiers posing with severed heads , others with them standing amid skulls in the dirt . the victims are reported to have died in mass burnings and by drowning , torture , gas , poison , disease and starvation . children were reported to have been loaded into boats , taken out to sea and thrown overboard . rape , too , was frequently reported . in addition , according to the website armenian-genocide . org , `` the great bulk of the armenian population was forcibly removed from armenia and anatolia to syria , where the vast majority was sent into the desert to die of thirst and hunger . '' no . genocide was not even a word at the time , much less a legally defined crime . the word `` genocide '' was invented in 1944 by a polish lawyer named raphael lemkin to describe the nazis ' systematic attempt to eradicate jews from europe . he formed the word by combining the greek word for race with the latin word for killing . genocide became a crime in 1948 , when the united nations approved the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide . the definition included acts meant `` to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group . '' armenia , the vatican , the european parliament , france , russia and canada . germany is expected to join that group on friday , the 100th anniversary of the start of the killings . turkey , the united states , the european commission , the united kingdom and the united nations . a u.n. subcommittee called the killings genocide in 1985 , but current u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon declines to use the word . also , a year ago , on the eve of the 99th anniversary of red sunday , then-turkish prime minister -lrb- now-president -rrb- recep tayyip erdogan offered condolences for the mass killings , which he said had `` inhumane consequences . '' while turkey vehemently continues to reject the word `` genocide , '' his remarks went further than those of any previous turkish leader in acknowledging the suffering of armenians .",

'' -lrb- he -rrb- let them believe that he was the victim , '' french president francois hollande said wednesday . `` but police understood that there was an investigation that needed to be initiated . '' that probe started in earnest when police spotted traces of blood and bags in the suspect 's car . based on this discovery `` and in view of the attitude and suspicious behavior of the individual , '' they looked inside the car and found a loaded kalashnikov gun , a 9-mm revolver , three cell phones , a laptop , a usb key , a satellite navigation system `` and handwritten documents that contained information on possible targets , '' molins said . a search inside his home turned up yet more potentially key evidence , including three more kalashnikovs , three bulletproof vests , police armbands , a camera , some 2,000 euros in cash and `` documents in arabic mentioning al qaeda and isis , '' according to the prosecutor . `` a terrorist attack has been foiled , '' hollande said . `` it 's not the first time . '' earlier ghlam was identified as a computer science student originally from algeria . according to molins , he lived in that north african country until 2001 , joined his parents in france for the next two years , then went back to algeria . he got his undergraduate degree in that nation , then returned to france to study electronics . he 'd never been convicted of a crime ; in fact , the lone accusation against him in august 2013 was later withdrawn . but that did n't mean french authorities did n't know about ghlam . `` he had been noticed wishing to go to syria , '' molins explained . the prosecutor added that authorities found nothing to suggest he was imminent threat , `` but he was under surveillance . '' law enforcement checked on the man once in 2014 and again this year , cazeneuve said . the minister said the man planned to head to syria , a country embroiled in a bloody , years-long civil war that has attracted foreigners wishing to join extremist militant groups like isis . there was no indication he ever made it . but , molins said , computer searches revealed that the man had been communicating with someone in syria who `` asked him to target a church . '' what church ? authorities did n't disclose that detail on wednesday , though molins did say `` this target was confirmed by -lrb- the suspect 's satellite navigation system -rrb- and handwritten documents in his car . '' paris is home to the famed notre dame cathedral and sacre coeur basilica , both huge draws for tourists . it 's not known if either were in line to be attacked , but prime minister manuel valls wednesday visited one of the churches allegedly targeted , which was located in the paris suburb of villejuif . assuming ghlam does n't walk free anytime soon -- for now , he 's in custody awaiting possible charges -- that attack wo n't happen anytime soon . but authorities say he 's already claimed at least one victim . her name is aurelie chatelain . the 32-year-old was found dead sunday morning sitting in the passenger seat of a parked car in villejuif , killed by a single bullet that struck her shoulder , went through her body and ended up embedded in the seat . cazeneuve said chatelain was the mother of a 5-year-old girl and had come to the region on saturday to attend a training class . it 's not known what connection , if any , she had with the suspect . nonetheless , molins said that ballistics , dna , satellite navigation and other evidence connected him to the death of chatelain , who molins called the region 's first victim of terrorism since january . that 's when the massacre at charlie hebdo 's offices and the siege of a kosher market in paris took place , prompting french authorities to beef up security measures . `` france , like other countries , is facing a terror threat that is unprecedented in its nature and magnitude , '' valls said .

'' but many experts say north korea appears to be investing more in cyberwarfare because it is cheaper than spending on conventional weapons and can cause significant economic damage to its southern rival . indeed south korea 's defense ministry estimates that north korea is operating a `` cyberarmy '' of 6,000 workers as it focuses on strengthening its asymmetrical warfare capability . `` hacks are going on all the time , constantly -- though how many actually make the news is a very small amount , '' said james . `` how many are detected in general ? i think the average person would have no clue they 've been hacked . `` organizations need to invest the same amount that hackers are investing to protect themselves and right now they 're not , '' he added . many in south korea believe not enough effort is being put into defending against cyberattacks . a report by the korea institute for industrial economics and trade , a government-funded think tank , estimates that `` dark seoul '' caused about $ 820 million worth of damage . its report , published in 2014 , predicted that by 2020 , south korea could be exposed to hacking attacks causing up to $ 25 billion in economic damage .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- the world 's seventh-largest economy is heading toward collapse . an economic powerhouse conservatively valued at $ 24 trillion , one that annually churns out the equivalent of $ 2.5 trillion , is under assault . however , i am not referring to one of the g8 economies , but to the `` super economy '' of the ocean . it 's one that for far too long has been ignored and taken for granted -- and it is going downhill fast . the health and wealth of the ocean are assessed in a wwf report released thursday , reviving the ocean economy . the report is the result of a hard economic analysis performed by the boston consulting group built on a foundation of the latest ocean science provided by the global change institute of the university of queensland . true , the enormity of the ocean can complicate any single appraisal . but it is still important to try to understand its value if global leaders are ever going to sustain it for future generations . the fact is that the ocean feeds us , employs us , offers protection and plays a direct role in the lives and livelihoods of people throughout the world . the ocean also provides intangible but essential services to humanity , such as climate regulation and oxygen production , that are difficult to put in monetary terms . and while we all may look at the ocean from different perspectives , no one can escape the fact that it is a shared resource that provides for each and every one of us . a figure that may get lost in the headlines generated by our report is perhaps most telling : seventy percent of the ocean 's overall economic value relies on its continued health . ocean assets like fisheries , coral reefs , mangroves and seagrasses that produce goods and services rivaling the world 's top 10 economies will lose their value if we continue to over-exploit and outright destroy them . that may seem like a far-off possibility to some , but it is a future foretold by the many details in this report . for example , 90 percent of the world 's fish stocks are either fully exploited or over-exploited . and that is not all . by 2050 -- only a few decades from now -- it is possible that the ocean could lose its coral reefs , which have already been halved in the last few decades . this is n't just a concern for dive enthusiasts , but to the hundreds of millions of people that rely on ocean resources for their daily meals and their weekly paychecks . the ocean is truly too big to fail . the loss of the ocean 's critical habitats and species would have a devastating ripple effect on global food security and economies that no government bailout could salvage . fortunately , our report identifies actions that would revive the ocean economy , three of which are critical this year . first , the international community must rally around a set of sustainable development goals that clearly reflect the link between the environment -- including the ocean -- and human well-being . also , negotiators meeting in paris later this year must agree on an ambitious global climate deal that sets us on the path to avert the worst impacts of climate change . and finally , leaders must commit to conserving increasing amounts of coastal and marine areas over the course of the next 15 years . the economic case for why the ocean is so critical to livelihoods around the world is clear , and we will not be able to plead ignorance if we collectively preside over the collapse of the ocean economy . reviving the ocean economy is dedicated to helping us avoid that outcome , but it will require political vision and courage among policymakers . all this said , and as terrifying as it is that the deterioration of the ocean 's health has been its fastest in millions of years , there is actually some -lrb- potential -rrb- good news : if we act swiftly and with determination , marine resources can recover -- and recover quickly . many local examples -- from the mediterranean to the mozambique channel , from the fiji archipelago to the arctic -- show us that conservation , restoration and sustainable-use approaches mean the ocean , and the people who depend on it , can both prosper . ultimately , the ocean bridges continents , connects cultures and offers equal opportunity inspiration and we should therefore work together in support of this vital shared resource . but if we are to have any chance of avoiding the point of no return , we must find ways of reaching genuine global commitments on sustainable development and climate . after all , it 's far better to avoid an economic collapse than be forced to scramble to pick up the pieces .",

'' records are nice , but bruce mate , the lead author of the study , thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim . during her 14,000-mile journey , varvara visited `` three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales , '' which was a surprise to mate , who is also the director of the marine mammal institute at oregon state university . `` for her to go to mexico , '' mate said , `` it 's pretty strong evidence that it 's where she 's from . '' varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale , but her ability to `` navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive , '' he said in the release , which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays . with only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence , that number might be even lower . `` past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species , but this suggests we may need to take a closer look , '' mate said . fourth baby orca born this season .",

'' and , finally , `` lose some weight , baby girl . '' it 's pretty cringe-worthy stuff that seems difficult , if not impossible , to defend . mchenry quickly issued an apology , blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility . it was , however , too late : the #firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on twitter , where she was called everything from classist , class-less , and `` ugly on the inside '' to a `` sad , self-hating coward . '' espn , meanwhile , announced that mchenry would be suspended for a week . certainly mchenry should have known better than to have used such words , even if that 's what she was thinking , least of all because in our youtube age , such missteps always come to light . but while mchenry 's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement , evidence of a mean girl who never left high school , what 's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on mchenry without fully knowing -- or , it seems , caring about -- the other side of the story . the video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only mchenry 's responses , not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on . mchenry knew she was being taped ; at one point , she looks directly at the camera . the employee even threatens to make the video public . did mchenry keep going because she has that much of a self-destructive streak ? or because she truly could not help herself ? or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game ? how britt mchenry could have responded . these days , there 's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace , whether it 's lindsay lohan or brian williams or britt mchenry , who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing : that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial . the high price of public shaming online . sure , mchenry probably feels entitled , but that 's our doing , too . we 're a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal -- celebrating them , compensating them . and yet when , in a moment of frustration and stress , mchenry lets the entitlement bestowed on her win out over taking a deep breath and walking away , we 're right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve . you know what gives her the nerve ? we do . -lrb- be honest : when is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot ? -rrb- . but we 're really no better than she is . the problem with social media , and our dependence on it , is that it allows people to present and receive whatever angle they want , biased or not , fair or not . it 's the `` power of the press '' without the objectivity or accountability demanded of the actual press . and it has enabled a dangerous vigilantism that makes those who use that power no different from the ones they are supposedly rallying against . think about it . who was worse : mchenry or the people who made that video public , and who did so without owning up to their part in the conversation ? who is worse : britt mchenry for childishly mocking a confrontational tow employee 's bad teeth , or the twitter masses who call for justice and `` the return of class '' -- who express views like , `` part of me feels bad for britt mchenry . poor thing actually believes she was hired for ` brains ' and ` education ' ? should n't they question whether , in fact , mchenry could have actually been standing up for herself ? sorry to break it to you , but these days , we 're all bullies . at least britt mchenry owns up to it .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's clear from hillary clinton 's campaign rollout -- a video announcement/campaign ad/short film that debuted sunday afternoon -- that she will make women and being a woman central to her outreach . in case you 're skeptical , vox has posted a handy `` by the numbers '' for her campaign video , and there are 38 people besides clinton in the two-minute ad . twenty of them are women . there are three separate mentions of motherhood . this is all fine and good -lrb- and predictable -rrb- if you acknowledge that the proportion of women who vote has exceeded the proportion of men who vote in every presidential election since 1980 . and let 's not overlook the fact that clinton is in fact a woman , and that 's a fine thing to celebrate . but in reality , she does n't have to wonder if a woman-centered campaign is the best strategy . she can simply look back to the most recent elections to see that overplaying to one half of the eligible-voting population failed spectacularly all over the country , in red and blue states , when that strategy was employed by both male and female candidates . as i 've previously written , the 2014 midterm elections saw the death of a political meme : the `` war on women . '' granted , that 's not because republicans convinced the country that they were the party of women . but it is noteworthy that democrats who overtly pandered to women at the expense of real issues -lrb- and men -rrb- crashed and burned . to wit : . in colorado , sen. mark udall was nicknamed `` mark uterus '' for all the time he spent fear-mongering on women 's reproductive issues , only to end up , according to exit polls , eight points ahead among women . his opponent , cory gardner , finished 17 points ahead among men . in new york , a democratic candidate for congress , martha robertson , drew laughs from the audience during a debate for accusing her opponent of engaging in a `` war on women . '' to repeat , she was a woman , a democrat , in new york . in louisiana , sen. mary landrieu sought to give her ailing campaign a boost in by part blaming sexism for democrats ' lack of popularity in the south . not surprisingly , southerners voted for her opponent , bill cassidy . in texas , where liberal wendy davis ran almost entirely on an abortion-rights platform , she accused republicans of sexism for daring to scrutinize her inaccurate biography . her opponent , greg abbott , won by 20 points , and davis only ended up with 47 % of the women vote . whether in texas or colorado , new york or louisiana , voters made it clear they cared about more than just reproductive issues and were n't going to be bullied into voting democratic by false cries of sexism . but while democrats were screaming about the republicans ' `` war on women , '' few in the media acknowledged that the democrats ' deficit among men was actually greater than the republicans ' deficit among women . exit polls in 2014 showed that men voted for republicans over democrats by a 16-point margin , and women voted for democrats by only a four-point margin . regardless of whom republicans run for president , hillary clinton will most likely get the women vote . what she needs are men . so instead of running a woman-centered campaign , she might want to figure out a way to court the other sex .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- marco rubio is all in . the republican senator from florida has announced that he is seeking the republican presidential nomination , running on an optimistic message that he embodies the promise of the american dream . with his youthful energy and hispanic roots , it 's tempting to see rubio as the new blood that the gop needs in order to compete against hillary clinton in 2016 . yet rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues : immigration reform and cuba relations . he holds little appeal to latino voters . and unless he can offer new ideas , his climb to the republican nomination will be steep . back in 2013 , rubio was a member of the senate `` gang of 8 '' that crafted a bipartisan proposal for comprehensive reform , including a path to citizenship for the nation 's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants . he later distanced himself from the bill after it ran into resistance from house republicans , and now says he favors a piecemeal approach , starting with securing the border . his retreat on immigration means that rubio has missed an opportunity to set himself apart from most of the presumptive republican presidential candidates . that 's a shame , for this issue was supposed to be his calling card to latino voters . instead , rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration . he believes that president obama 's deferred action program , offering deportation relief to young immigrants , should be ended . he has stated that the president 's executive action on immigration , on hold pending a circuit court review , sets a `` horrifying precedent . '' meanwhile , both the deferred action program and president obama 's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by hispanics . no wonder the research firm latino decisions reports that , `` we find no evidence that rubio 's candidacy will draw significant latino support for his candidacy or for his party more generally . '' so , if rubio is counting on his ethnicity and personal history as the son of immigrants to win over fellow hispanics , he is mistaken . at a private breakfast monday for supporters , rubio described running against `` one candidate in the race who 's from yesterday , and one who wants to take us back to yesterday . '' but when it comes to cuba policy , rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past . over the weekend , he called the recent thaw in relations between the two countries ridiculous . he has warned that cuba is taking advantage of the united states . here , he is an increasingly lonely voice . most americans support better relations with cuba , as do a majority of cuban-americans . by clinging to the notion that isolating cuba is better than engaging with the communist country , rubio has marginalized himself on an issue where he could have provided insight and leadership . immigration and cuba policy aside , rubio 's political philosophy will be a tough sell to hispanics . he is a fierce opponent of `` obamacare '' and wants the law repealed . however , the affordable care act has led to a 12.3 % drop in the hispanic uninsured rate , making latinos the demographic with the largest gain in insurance , thanks to the law . -lrb- in fact , rubio signed his own family up for `` obamacare '' on the washington exchange , taking advantage of a generous federal subsidy offered to lawmakers . -rrb- . rubio favors smaller government , while latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less . and though rubio doubts that climate change is caused by humans , the new york times has noted that latinos view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue . sure , rubio is young and charismatic . but his work on the failed immigration bill notwithstanding , rubio has a significant lack of accomplishments to show for his five years in the senate . in february , he was reported as topping the list of absentee lawmakers by the website politico . another rubio weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals . consider that his fellow contender for the gop presidential nomination , sen. rand paul of kentucky , has been willing to present new ideas to the republican base , such as reforming the criminal justice system and legalizing medical marijuana . or that another gop candidate for president , sen. ted cruz of texas is entirely comfortable with his image as a conservative firebrand . by comparison , rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the task of rousing republican voters . with his early leap into the 2016 race , marco rubio is positioning himself as the next generation of gop leadership . unfortunately , a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination -- not for rubio , and not for latino voters .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- sleek chassis , alluring paintwork and a need for speed , but these are no ordinary motors . when pedal hits metal , an eco-friendly process gets set in motion . powered by electricity and engineered for efficiency , car enthusiasts from across africa are sparking home-grown concepts that have gotten experts revving . in zaria , a city in northern nigeria , a team of students from the ahmadu bello university are currently applying the final touches to the `` abucar 2 . '' the students used locally available materials to build the vehicle , and even included recycled electrical components in the engine . while it runs on gasoline , the engine maximizes fuel efficiency and produces fewer emissions than normal cars . `` we are sure we have a great car , '' says the project 's supervisor muhammad dauda . `` now we are focusing on making some final enhancements to hone the driving strategy -- this is just like formula one . '' their compact creation , which was built over five months , will travel to the netherlands in may to compete in the european leg of this year 's shell eco-marathon -- the motoring competition rewards those who travel the longest distance using the least amount of fuel . but the team is also working towards a hybrid petro-electric motor , which they hope to unveil in 2016 . at low speeds the vehicle will be powered by electricity alone , but at higher speeds both electric and petrol components will work together . between extremes , excess power generated by the engine recharges the batteries that power the electric motor . it 's the model that toyota uses in the prius . green-focused designs like these are increasingly needed on the continent , as some studies say 50 % of global emissions of organic carbon could come from africa in 2030 . at may 's shell eco-marathon , abucar 's team will be hoping to race past the sleek `` autonov iii '' creation from the university of lagos . painted the colors of the nigerian flag and powered by a solar battery , the car 's aerodynamic teardrop shape helps minimize drag . constructing earlier iterations of this vehicle was put under stress in 2013 when university teachers went on a six month strike , but the industrial action did n't stop the team from tinkering with the electric engine . `` we 've used small tires to reduce the overall weight of the vehicle , '' explains team manager chukwuemeka isiogu . `` we 've trained ourselves to just think about fuel efficiency and create the most efficient vehicle . '' other eco-friendly engineers are less about sleek and more focused on comfort . uganda 's makerere university has produced a two-seater electric car called `` kiira ev '' . with a super-light fibreglass body and lithium ion battery , the car can go 50 miles on a single charge . the design project cost $ 35,000 , but the engineers made sure to include leather seats and a cd player . whilst working on the kiira , the team is also developing an 28-seater electric bus which will run on a mixture of electric and solar power . innovative creations have also come from the university of benin in nigeria . their `` tuke-tuke '' car -- named after local mini-buses -- is made from locally available materials . the brake pads , for example , are made from palm kernels . tuke-tuke also has some key features that will come in handy when slipping through the city 's streets . windscreen wipers start automatically when rain hits the sensors , gears can be changed with the touch of a button and owners use their finger rather than a key to unlock the doors . and when it gets dark , the driver just needs to clap their hands to turn on the interior lights . elsewhere , engineers are working on green vehicles for the whole family . one ghanaian inventor is building suvs with electric motors powered by rechargeable batteries . apostle safo , who also founded a church , dreams big in his five-seater creations which are hand built in gomoa mpota , except for the headlights and tires . while he says the product will be affordable , it remains to be seen just how much a handmade suv would cost . these innovations certainly are impressive concepts , but it 's unlikely electric vehicles will be filling roads on the continent any time soon -- it is unclear how economically viable it would be for governments and companies to build the right number of charging points , but the issue of power itself is even more pressing . `` reliability when it comes to electricity supply is key , '' says south african sustainability consultant anthony dane . `` convincing consumers across africa to invest in an electric vehicle whilst electricity shortages are such a major issue in so many communities is a challenge .

'' hillary clinton has leased her headquarters space in brooklyn and will soon make her presidential campaign official . and with the launch , jonathan martin of the new york times reports , will come a carefully orchestrated effort to reintroduce clinton -- with an emphasis on her childhood and her earlier work on children 's issues . `` the democrats around hillary clinton believe that while she 's one of the most famous people in the world , she 's never been properly introduced in her own right , '' said martin . `` so when she does roll out her campaign here in a couple of weeks , look for more biographical touches . we 'll hear about her childhood in suburban chicago and some of the work that she did as an advocate for the legal services corporation and the children 's defense fund when she was in her 30s , and also , more about her arkansas days as first lady , as an advocate for education . '' a lot of the big names signing on to team clinton are already known . but dan balz of the washington post explains part of the statement her campaign wants to make with the announcement is to show it has a large , experienced staff ready for the key national and state roles . `` what i 'm hearing is that when they launch , this staff is going to be even much , much bigger than we , at this point , imagine , that they have done a huge amount of hiring , '' said balz . and balz reports the planning centers on smaller events designed to highlight more personal interaction . `` she did an event with the wife of the mayor of new york earlier this week that could be a template for the kinds of things they 're doing . '' much of the media attention on the corruption indictment against democratic sen. robert menendez of new jersey has been on its allegations of luxury hotel stays with girlfriends . but beyond the more tabloidesque details , jackie kucinich of the daily beast notes that one of the charges centers on a suggestion the senator 's staff was soliciting funds for a so-called super pac -- a violation of campaign finance laws . and she says the scrutiny of that practice might grow because of the menendez allegations . `` i was talking to some campaign finance watchdogs this week and they say if the -lrb- federal election commission -rrb- really starts to look into this , they 're actually going to find some impropriety with other lawmakers much much farther than menendez , '' said kucinich . `` so watch for that if it starts happening . '' by a week from monday , there will be three official gop candidates for president : ted cruz , rand paul and marco rubio . others will soon follow , and as things get more official , pressure is mounting on gop operatives to choose sides . in new hampshire this past week , matt maroney , a former mitt romney alum with ground organizing experience , signed on with new jersey gov. chris christie 's team . others in the state reported calls coming in from ohio gov. john kasich and , yes , even donald trump . this dynamic plays out on the national level , too : republican pollster tony fabrizio , for example , was approached both by team christie and by allies of wisconsin gov. scott walker . in the end , though , fabrizio signed on with sen. rand paul of kentucky , who makes his official announcement on tuesday .",

'' for climate change `` next year '' is now . this year is the time and the united nations ' international climate negotiations in paris in december are the place to secure strong global agreement to curb heat-trapping emissions . a successful climate pact will send a signal around the world that a shift to a low-carbon economy is underway . the united states has made clear that it is ready to step up to the plate on climate change . the u.s. administration on tuesday unveiled details about its proposal to reduce u.s. greenhouse gas emissions by 26 % to 28 % below 2005 levels by 2025 . this common-sense and achievable plan to decarbonize the u.s. economy will result in significant cost savings from cleaner technologies and create more american energy jobs to power our homes and businesses . this is an area where the united states needs to lead , and doing so will create a better planet for our children and a more prosperous future for our country . the united states is n't alone in this global climate effort . in a landmark joint announcement with the united states in november , china unveiled its intent to peak its carbon emissions around 2030 and to double its share of zero-carbon energy to 20 % . this shift will require substantial effort from china to retool its economy , increase investment in renewable energy and divest from coal . as the world 's no. 1 investor in renewable energy , china has already taken important steps forward . at the same time , india has set the audacious goal of installing 100 gigawatts of solar power capacity by 2022 , a 30-fold increase from current levels and eight times more solar capacity than the united states has today . cities and corporations are joining in as well . more than 200 cities , home to 436 million people , have voluntarily committed to saving 13 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury . and more than a thousand companies , along with 73 countries , voiced support for putting a price on carbon and moving to cleaner energy technologies . leading companies , like apple and google , are making major bets on renewable energy . and another 25 businesses have signed onto the corporate renewable energy buyers ' principles -- these companies represent energy demand equal to more than 1 million homes . increasing examples demonstrate that strong climate action can be good for the economy . for instance , renewable sources now provide one-fifth of the world 's electricity , while solar manufacturing costs have dropped 80 % in the last seven years . wind turbines installed now are 100 times better at generating power than turbines were 30 years ago . clean technology investments surged to $ 310 billion last year . in the united states , carbon emissions fell by 10 % from 2007 to 2013 , the largest absolute emissions reduction recorded , even as the united states has recovered from the great recession . many of these shifts are unprecedented and could not have been anticipated even five years ago . yet these trends alone are not enough to counter the mounting climate-related impacts that we are already seeing . a global climate agreement in paris this december can send more signals to markets and drive more ambitious climate action for decades to come . a paris agreement would represent a new form of international cooperation and a fundamental change in the global approach to climate action -- a shift from burden-sharing to the creation of mutual opportunities ; from cost to investment ; from economic threat to a spur to economic development . with the united states showing the way , and with cooperation from other countries , businesses , investors , cities and citizens , we can achieve a prosperous and secure future for all . each year , baseball returns and hope springs eternal . now , it 's time for all countries to get in the game .",

    "article": "tokyo -lrb- cnn -rrb- a week after a japanese court issued a landmark injunction halting plans to restart two nuclear reactors in a western prefecture , a different court has rejected a petition by residents to delay the reactivation of reactors in the country 's southwest . kagoshima district court found no `` irrationalities '' in new safety standards set out by the government in the wake of the 2011 fukushima meltdowns , japanese news agency kyodo reported . by dismissing resident 's demands , the court ruled that the sendai nuclear power plant in kagoshima could restart . the first of two reactors is scheduled to go back online in july . the ruling could provide a fillip to the government 's plans to bring japanese nuclear reactors back into operation , more than four years since the earthquake and subsequent tsunami that caused the failure at tepco 's fukushima plant . the original court ruling , which affects the takahama plant in fukui prefecture , cited safety concerns as the reason for the injunction , a court official told cnn . japan 's nuclear watchdog , the nuclear regulation authority , had previously given a green light to the reopening of reactors 3 and 4 of the kansai electric power company 's plant . but locals successfully petitioned the court in fukui , raising concerns about whether the reactors would survive a strong earthquake . japan 's 48 nuclear reactors are offline in the wake of the fukushima disaster in 2011 , when a tsunami triggered by a massive earthquake sent a wall of water crashing into the power plant . since then , the island nation has imported greater amounts of expensive natural gas and coal to meet its energy needs . japanese prime minister shinzo abe has pushed for a return to nuclear energy , arguing it is essential to the country 's economic recovery to reduce the skyrocketing utility bills associated with energy imports . but opinion polls have consistently shown public opposition to a nuclear restart . keith henry , managing director of tokyo-based asia strategy , which advises businesses on japanese public policy issues , says the decision will force abe to rethink the economics of his energy policy . `` that was a body blow -lrb- for abe -rrb- because it 's no longer a political issue , it 's a legal issue . it changes the calculus and the dynamics , '' he said . `` it 's now in the courts . and the government is powerless to do anything about it .

'' her daughter asked during a recorded interview with egyptian television network cbc . `` your father died and i was six months pregnant with you . '' she replied . `` none of my siblings helped me . i raised you and sent you to school . without money i could not have gotten you an education . '' a widow at just 21 , dahou was forced to fend for herself in egypt 's patriarchal south , where decades ago it was unheard of for women to earn their own living . even in recent years , women make up barely 24 % of egypt 's workforce , according to the world bank . `` it is considered wrong that i dressed as a man but no one can judge . not you or anyone else . only god can judge me , '' dahou said , `` people talked but i said i decided to be a man so i can take care of my small daughter . '' the breadwinner worked as a brick maker for just 25 piasters , the equivalent of a few cents , until she saved up enough money to buy a shoeshine kit . she found a place for her wooden box , painted with red hearts and the egyptian flag , alongside the all-male shoe shiners of her community . `` if it was n't for my mother , i would have been on the streets '' houda , her daughter , told tv host mona al-shazly through tears . `` honestly i would have been in the streets . i did not find a home except with my mother . and even today my children rely on her .

'' the days were long and tedious . now it was over . `` it 's been an incredibly emotional toll on all of us , '' lesa strachan told cnn 's anderson cooper thursday in the first nationally televised interview with members of the jury . a day earlier , strachan , the jury foreperson , announced the first-degree murder conviction in the 2013 shooting death of hernandez 's onetime friend odin lloyd . strachan said she was struck by the viciousness of multiple gunshots . `` you shot him once but you kept going and you shot him six times . there 's no need for that and there 's no need to use a gun . period . '' before the trial , at least one juror -- rosalie oliver -- had n't heard of the 25-year-old defendant who has now gone from a $ 40 million pro-football contract to a term of life without parole in a maximum-security prison . but kelly dorsey watches the patriots every sunday during the football season . she said so on her jury questionnaire . `` i knew of him as a football player , not a person , '' she said . it did n't affect her vote to convict , she said . it did n't matter that he was a football player , she said . nor did it matter whether he actually pulled the trigger in the murder . `` to leave your friend on the ground , knowing that he 's not there anymore -- he 's either dead or he 's going to die -- that 's indifference , '' dorsey said of hernandez . `` he did n't need to pull the trigger . '' that word -- `` indifference '' -- was used multiple times by members of the jury . jon carlson said he was struck by testimony and video evidence that hernandez and two co-defendants were sunbathing poolside hours after the slaying , drinking smoothies . hernandez at times left his then-8-month-old daughter with the two men . that indifference `` surprised a lot of us , '' carlson said . he stressed the fact that hernandez played football for a living did n't influence the jury 's decision . `` it does n't matter how much money you have or how much money you make . we 're all people , and we 're all equal , and we all deserve the same fair trial , and that 's what we wanted to make sure we gave him , '' carlson said . lloyd was seen june 17 , 2013 , around 2:30 a.m. with hernandez and hernandez 's friends , carlos ortiz and ernest wallace , in a rented silver nissan altima . later that day , a jogger found his body . he had been shot six times , according to prosecutors . wallace and ortiz , who were also charged with murder , have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately . what 's next for aaron hernandez ? rosalie oliver -- the juror who had n't heard of hernandez before the trial -- said that , for her , the first shot was enough . `` there was no need for the other five , '' she said . `` one shot for me is cruelty .

'' this curious paradox holds true today . our knowledge of the causes and dangers of climate change has increased even as our ignorance of its ramifications has unfolded . many of our elected representatives persist in inaction and complacency by arguing that individual nations are powerless to solve the problem because every nation is culpable . others choose to dispute the science , deny the evidence , and avoid the question of how to solve the problem . but climate change is only scary if we choose to sit , wait and do nothing about it . president kennedy encountered the same dilemma : `` it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer to rest , to wait . but ... this country of the united states was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them . '' we need not be frightened today . climate change is a chance for all of us to add a chapter to the story of american triumph and human progress . it is a moment for this generation to display the very qualities we attribute to the american political heroes of earlier times , who left the world a better place for us . courage of this scale will come from a people who are told that they can do great things by leaders who believe that their people are capable of great things . we believe that america will see opportunity in the danger of climate change just like we saw benefits on earth from travel in space . kennedy told the crowd at rice that the pursuit of a goal that seemed impossible was valuable precisely because it would be so hard to accomplish . `` we choose to go to the moon not because it is easy but because it is hard , '' he said . something so difficult would only be achieved through cooperation and national unity , and it would push us toward greatness . there will always be reasons for inaction . many will argue that responsible reforms will hurt our economy as it recovers from the great recession . they will exploit the fears of that time to justify extracting rents from industries and fuels whose days are numbered . progress on climate change will require courage . some leaders who stand up to meet the challenge may fall , but they can be sure that their sacrifice will light the world with more energy , more mobility and more freedom and ensure a healthier planet . we can start by making straightforward changes in the tax code that are acceptable to both the right and the left . by adopting policies that would make it in our trading partners ' interest to join us , meaningful reforms can provide solutions without making government any bigger . as americans , we are obligated to leave the world a better place than we found it . we believe , just as president kennedy did , that only if america leads on the most important issues of our time can we deliver on that promise . we call on our elected leaders to embrace the climate challenge before us and light a path to greatness once again .",

'' `` we are tremendously proud of him and the humanitarian work he did , '' the school said . at the time he was taken captive , lo porto worked with the german aid organization welthungerlife , a 53-year-old group dedicated to fighting hunger and poverty worldwide . such work means going to places where the need is most -- places like multan in pakistan . that community was one of many in pakistan devastated by major flooding in 2010 , which covered about one-fifth of the country and left more than 1,500 people dead . these conditions are all too common in the south asian nation , as evidenced by flooding one year later that forced upwards of 660,000 into refugee camps and killed more than 430 people , about a quarter of whom were children . `` he told me , ` i 'm pleased to have returned to asia and pakistan , i love the people , culture and food in this part of the world , ' '' said the london metropolitan university professor . specifically , lo porto was a project manager with welthungerlife 's clean water and sanitation program , working with 8 to 10 fellow international staffers and 100 to 200 locals starting in october 2011 , according to simone pott , a spokeswoman for the aid group . pott described lo porto as a lively , very positive man who made friends all over the world . some of those friends in italy , england and beyond pressed for lo porto 's release after he was taken captive , urging italy 's government and newspaper editors to get his story out , ansa reported . the same story said that al qaeda -lrb- after first claiming he was being held -rrb- denied abducting lo porto , as did the pakistani taliban . muehlenbeck , a german national , was freed last october , at which time he said that he and his colleague had been separated , according to ansa . but lo porto never got the chance to savor freedom again , like his german counterpart . italian foreign minister paolo gentiloni said his country 's government `` carried out every effort possible to trace and try to return giovanni to his loved ones . '' `` unfortunately , the conclusion is now different -lrb- than we wanted -rrb- because of the tragic and fatal mistake of our american allies , which has been recognized by president obama , '' gentiloni said . `` the responsibility of his death and -lrb- that -rrb- of warren weinstein ... is that of the terrorists .

'' fouad ajami , the late hoover institute fellow who was also a frequent guest on cnn , took issue with the book . `` the crowds in baghdad and basra -lrb- like the crowds in kabul that greeted their liberators with kites and music -rrb- may yet embarrass mackey and the countless naive people who see things her way , '' ajami wrote for the new york times ' sunday book review cover story in 2002 . mackey had an oklahoma twang , the slightly nasal kind that she was proud of , but that belied her worldly understanding . she would use it to full effect when she wanted to put people at ease . mackey was a frequent commentator on cnn during the gulf war in the 1990s . she also appeared on countless other outlets , including bill maher 's `` politically incorrect , '' to explain in layman 's terms what was happening in the region . her book on iraq was published one year before the u.s.-led invasion of the country in 2003 . the book forewarned of the consequences of such action . `` in a perfect world , shia , sunni , and kurd , followed by a company of other minorities , would walk into the post-hussein iraq as a liberated people united by common suffering , '' mackey wrote . `` but as all those who plot the way of nations are so acutely aware , the world is not perfect . '' she said those calling for an invasion of iraq `` can not ignore the threats to american security that could come with hussein 's demise . '' `` with american troops on the ground and no governing authority capable of taking charge , the united states faces the real possibility of a secular version of militant islam , '' mackey said . '' ... thus , american military forces rotate in and out , u.s. taxpayer money finances the occupation , and iraqi hostility to a western presence increases . there is no exit strategy except retreat . '' in 2004 the u.s. military actually flew mackey to iraq to teach commanders from the army 's 1st infantry division while the war was still raging . her book on iraq became required reading for many military officers . `` i am literally a little old lady in tennis shoes , '' she used to joke about her ability to gain the confidence of countless sources . `` what 's the harm in talking to me ?

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- saturday 's deadly earthquake in nepal was the `` big one '' experts were waiting for based on the region 's history . earthquakes are a fact of life in the south asian country , with tremors of magnitude 4 or 5 occurring several times each year , geologist and science journalist kate ravilious said . with the last major earthquake in 1934 , the concern was not if , but when the next `` great '' earthquake would hit , said ravilious , author of the 2014 article , `` kathmandu 's earthquake nightmare . '' in a landlocked country like nepal , where infrastructure is fragile to begin with , the consequences of such an earthquake had the potential to be `` much more serious , '' ravilious told cnn . those fears were realized when a magnitude-7 .8 earthquake centered less than 50 miles from the national capital of kathmandu rocked nepal , toppling homes , historic buildings and leaving more 1,400 dead , authorities said . `` this event , while large and tragic , is not unusual for that region of the world as the whole mountain range stretching from tibet almost to caspian sea is an area of major collision between continental plates , '' said geological engineer nicholas sitar with the university of california , berkeley 's department of civil and environmental engineering . what 's different this time from 1934 is the size and density of kathmandu , which suffered the brunt of damage in both earthquakes . `` the population has exploded in several decades , '' u.s. geological survey spokesman gavin hayes told cnn . `` when you get a vast population in the kind of building infrastructure that is n't equipped to handle shaking of an earthquake this size , that 's when you see the scale of disaster we 're seeing now . '' the big unknown is what happens next , now that the initial rumbles of the quake have passed , ravilious said . how will emergency response teams enter the landlocked country , whose single international airport is closed ? how will transports carrying aid move through the country if roads are destroyed ? if and when landslides start , how will mountainside villages in the himalayan range fare ? and , will it all be resolved before monsoon season starts ? `` the worry now is to get nepal up and running again on feet , '' ravilious said . `` the monsoons in a couple of months could make things worse if we do n't sort things out before then . '' an earthquake is the ground shaking caused by a sudden slip on a fault , according to the u.s. geological survey . stresses in the earth 's outer layer push the sides of the fault together , releasing energy in waves that travel through the earth 's crust and cause the shaking felt during an earthquake . nepal is located on a major plate boundary between india and eurasia , where collisions have been in progress for about 50 million years . those collisions are responsible for the construction of the himalayas , which has the tallest and some of the fastest growing mountains in the world , said chris goldfinger , director of oregon state university 's active tectonics and seafloor mapping laboratory . india is moving northward into eurasia at a rate of about 45 millimeters a year , with earthquakes of a magnitude from 8 to 9 occurring on average in the himalaya every 500 to 1,000 years , said marin k. clark , associate professor of geological sciences with the university of michigan 's department of earth and environmental sciences . the last major earthquake to affect this part of the himalayas was in the 1500s , and kathmandu was badly damaged in an earthquake that occurred farther east of saturday 's quake in 1934 . a major concern for this earthquake is damage from landslides generated by the strong shaking , clark said . the entire area that experienced shaking was in steep , mountainous topography where landsliding is a significant hazard . clark compared the circumstances to the 2008 earthquake in sichuan province , china . the magnitude-7 .9 earthquake generated more 200,000 landslides , many of which blocked roads , slowing response and recovery efforts . the landslides also blocked river valleys , which created significant flood hazard . `` we might anticipate a similar situation for nepal .

'' but neither the patriots nor the nfl has anything to be ashamed of in how they handled the hernandez case . they did everything right this time . hours after hernandez was charged with murder , he was let go from the team . and his coaches did n't spend any time trying to convince the public that their star tight end was a decent , family-loving guy , as the league has done too many times in the past when its players got in trouble . this time justice worked . there 's no reason to second-guess what went wrong , to ask `` how could a star nfler be a murderer ? '' the nfl for the most part does a great job vetting its players , and certainly hernandez is an anomaly in the league , where despite the ugly headlines , the overwhelming majority of players are upstanding , law-abiding citizens . and patriots bashers -lrb- me included -rrb- would be mistaken to try to find fault with the team for drafting hernandez despite his troubled past . no one really knows what evil lurks in the hearts of others , even those closest to us . not the mothers whose sons go off and commit schoolyard killing sprees , or wives whose husbands gun down innocent people , and certainly not employers who are mostly concerned about performance on the job . there was no way to predict hernandez would end up a murderer . he was a guy who had all the talent and opportunity in the world , but he still went wrong . hernandez himself may have explained it best as he was being taken out of the courtroom : . according to a law enforcement source close to the case , hernandez told officers escorting him , '' ` hey man , i 'm going to miss you guys . ... i do n't need any luck any more . ' he gave you the impression , ` it 's kinda like no big deal . ... it is what it is . ' ''",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- fifty years ago in frankfurt , german prosecutors tried 22 former nazi ss soldiers at auschwitz in what remains the most famous holocaust trial staged in germany . at the time , fritz bauer , the german-jewish attorney general of hessen , expressed the simple hope that `` sooner or later , one of the accused would step forward and say : ` what took place -- it was horrific , i 'm sorry . ' then the entire world would exhale , as would all the survivors of those killed at auschwitz , and the air would be cleared . '' sadly , bauer observed , `` it has not been uttered , nor will it be . '' the refusal of perpetrators to own up to their guilt remains one of the most disappointing aspects of holocaust trials . john demjanjuk , whose conviction by a munich court in 2011 established the precedent that has now made possible the trial of oskar gr\u00f6ning , remained defiantly silent during his 18-month trial , never so much as breathing a word of acknowledgment or remorse . over the years , some defendants have acknowledged knowing of the exterminations , but have insisted that they played no role . those who acknowledged participating in the killing insisted that they did so out of fear of life or limb . over the years , an extraordinary research effort was dedicated to exploring the claim that ss men had engaged in extermination out of duress . the results were astonishing : investigators and historians failed to uncover so much as a single instance in which a german officer or nco had been executed or even severely punished for opting out of genocide . not one . these evasions and lies were often effective , as many german trials of holocaust perpetrators ended either in light sentences or outright acquittal . and even when a trial ended in a conviction , what was missing was any sense of moral reckoning , an acknowledgment on the part of the accused of the perversity of genocide . fritz bauer can now exhale . on april 21 , on the opening day of his trial in l\u00fcneburg , where he stands accused of complicity in the murder of 300,000 jews during his service at auschwitz , the 93-year-old gr\u00f6ning faced the court and acknowledged , `` it is beyond question that i am morally complicit . this moral guilt i acknowledge here , before the victims , with regret and humility . '' if nothing else comes from the trial , that statement alone justifies the undertaking . of course , in acknowledging his moral complicity , gr\u00f6ning fell short of confessing legal guilt . indeed , for years he has insisted in his innocence as a matter of law , arguing , in an interview with der spiegel in 2005 , that he had been no more than a `` cog in the gears . '' at auschwitz , gr\u00f6ning was responsible for inspecting the luggage of deportees to the camp -- most of whom were gassed within hours of their arrival -- for banknotes that would be carefully counted and sent to berlin . in performing this task , gr\u00f6ning insists that he never engaged in cruel , murderous or sadistic acts -- a claim that we can probably accept as true . but does this relieve him of criminal liability ? for decades german courts held that mere service as a concentration camp -- in the absence of evidence of a personal act of killing -- constituted no crime under german law . in 2011 , the demjanjuk conviction changed that . in convicting demjanjuk as an accessory to the murder of 28,000 jews at the sobibor death camp , the munich court concluded that death camp guards , regardless of how they had conducted themselves , had to be accessories to murder , because that was their job . it was a crucial breakthrough , because it recognized that mass killing is not a personal act of evil but an exterminatory process . when it comes to factory-like genocide , guilt is not to be measured by acts of cruelty or nastiness ; guilt follows function . convicting under that theory was the great accomplishment of the munich court . by this standard , gr\u00f6ning 's truthful claim that he was no more than `` a cog '' constitutes an admission of guilt . this does not mean that gr\u00f6ning deserves the same measure of punishment as an ss sadist . in fact , it 's not clear that he deserves any punishment besides the symbolic gesture of conviction . but without the court 's conviction , gr\u00f6ning 's important acceptance of moral guilt will remain incomplete . the significance of gr\u00f6ning 's trial can be measured in one final way . many have observed that it coincides with the 70th anniversary of the end of world war ii . but it also coincides with an anniversary of a different sort . april 24 marks the day that millions mourn the killing of hundreds of thousands of armenians by the ottomans during world war i , an event many have described as genocide . and yet the turkish nation itself remains in denial of the mass killings that unfolded a hundred years ago . with that in mind , gr\u00f6ning 's trial reminds us of other mass atrocities that still await their moment of moral and legal reckoning .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- have you ever found the creative inspiration you were seeking at the most unexpected time , or thought you were having that long-awaited problem-solving epiphany just as you nodded off to sleep ? according to neuroscientists john kounios and mark beeman , there 's a reason for that . their book , `` the eureka factor '' , explores the influences at work behind that much sought-after `` aha ! '' moment . research suggests that in trying to conjure up inspiration , most of us end up suppressing it . the book explains how to clear out mental junk , in order to make way for pivotal revelations . dr. kounios explained : `` insights involve unusual connections . cognitive psychologists call these ` remote associations ' . they are processed mostly in the brain 's right hemisphere . insights occur when a subconscious remote association suddenly pops into awareness . this is accompanied by a burst of activity in the brain 's right temporal lobe . '' `` we wrote `` the eureka factor '' to help people understand how creative insight works in the brain so they can use various strategies harmoniously without having them cross-circuit each other , '' said kounios . `` for example , there is evidence that imagining the future helps to put someone in an insightful state . however , if a person imagines a specific future that makes them anxious , then insightfulness could decrease because anxiety is a creativity killer . '' `` that said , a positive mood and a broad , expansive spread of attention are a couple of key features of the insightful state , '' he added . following are some of the tips they suggest for unleashing your creative potential -- both at home and at work . spaciousness helps broaden thoughts . even high ceilings have been shown to broaden attention . small , windowless offices , low ceilings and narrow corridors will do little to inspire our brains and make us flexible , creative thinkers . relaxing outdoor colors such as blue and green contribute to this state . `` emergency '' colors such as red suppress it . surprisingly , dark colors and dim lighting can also be beneficial : by obscuring visual details , they help people think more abstractly . static surroundings encourage static thinking . do n't be predictable . you should sometimes change everyday routines , such as where you go for coffee or your route to work . rearrange your furniture and decor from time to time , at home and in your workplace . hold meetings in a variety of places . make sure to include some nonconformists in your inner circle . unusual people tend to be out-of-the-box thinkers , and their unique outlook might help you attack a problem from a different angle . the threat of a firm deadline will narrow your thinking and inhibit your insight . try and use soft target dates and a flexible schedule to establish a helpful , nonthreatening time frame . rewards and punishments for meeting or missing deadlines , if needed at all , should be vague and mild so they do n't contribute added pressure . a positive outlook will help stimulate a more open mind , one that can process a greater number of ideas . if you struggle to think happy , try focusing on the people and things that bring you joy . to put a twist on pasteur 's famous saying , chance favors the happy mind . when you 're stuck on a problem , take a break to do or think about something very different . expose yourself to a variety of people and places . listen to music or go to a pleasing movie , art exhibit or talk a walk . play a game , dance , do yoga , read . insight triggers appear at the most unlikely times and places . we all know how important sleep is to our cognitive thinking . the sleep-deprived mind is more likely to fixate on small matters -- an absolute killer to creativity . ample sleep also helps foster the discovery of hidden connections between ideas . insightful thought is at its best when your powers of inhibition are weaker , because reduced focus opens up your awareness to remote associations that would n't come to you when you 're feeling sharp . if you 're an early bird , you should try doing your creative work at night . if you 're a night owl , try the morning . perhaps the single most important thing to remember is that your mental state can change . it takes a while to sink into an insightful mindset . try and schedule uninterrupted blocks of time for relaxed , freewheeling creative thought . turn off your phone . get rid of the clock . let abstract ideas and vague impressions flow where they will . tips have been extracted from the book `` the eureka factor '' , which has been written by dr. john kounios and dr. mark beeman . how missing sleep can damage your iq . how to make rejection work for you . 7 habits of highly ineffective people .",

'' unlike some critics , corliss appreciated all kinds of movies -- from the arty drama of ingmar bergman to the epic fantasy of `` the lord of the rings . '' his all-time top 100 movies list , which he compiled with fellow time critic richard schickel , contained everything from `` pulp fiction '' to `` finding nemo '' to jackie chan 's `` drunken master ii . '' `` he savored it all : the good , the bad , the indifferent . except that he was indifferent to nothing , '' zoglin wrote . `` to any fan or friend who would ask whether a new movie was ` worth seeing , ' corliss had a stock , succinct reply : ` everything is worth seeing . ' '' but corliss was not afraid to puncture hype around big movies he found overrated , including `` titanic '' -lrb- `` dead in the water '' -rrb- and even -- blasphemy ! -- `` star wars , '' about which he wrote , `` the movie 's ` legs ' will prove as vulnerable as c-3po 's . '' he also did n't care much for sentimental , uplifting movies that often become mainstream hits and win oscars . `` there are movies whose feel-good sentiments and slick craft annoy me so deeply that i know they will become box-office successes or top prizewinners , '' he once wrote . `` i call this internal mechanism my built-in hit detector . '' a graceful and prolific writer , corliss reviewed more than 1,000 movies , penned many time cover stories and authored four books on film , including `` mom in the movies : the iconic screen mothers you love -lrb- and a few you love to hate -rrb- , '' published just last year . -lrb- it was a partnership with turner classic movies , which , like cnn , is owned by turner broadcasting . -rrb- . some credit him with coining the phrase `` drop-dead gorgeous '' to describe actress michelle pfeiffer in a review of her 1985 film , `` into the night . '' he also cleverly , and subtly , gave away the big plot spoiler of `` the crying game '' by spelling it out with the first letters of each paragraph of his review . born in philadelphia , corliss moved to new york after college and began writing film reviews for a variety of publications before joining time in 1980 . he served as editor of film comment , the movie journal of the film society of lincoln center , for 20 years , was a frequent guest on charlie rose 's talk show and made annual pilgrimages to film festivals in cannes , toronto and venice . `` it 's painful to try to find words , since richard was such a master of them , '' time editor nancy gibbs wrote in a note friday to her staffers . `` they were his tools , his toys , to the point that it felt sometimes as though he had to write , like the rest of us breathe and eat and sleep . it 's not clear that richard ever slept , for the sheer expanse of his knowledge and writing defies the normal contours of professional life .

'' the bull of the heard weighed over 1,300 pounds and a collision with a car could easily have been fatal , heffernan said . new york state police helicopters were called in and nearby school districts were alerted to keep all students inside , heffernan said . four men from gem farms in schodack , new york , from where the buffalo escaped , were on the scene by a ravine in coeymans , new york , to kill the animals , a decision heffernan said was n't made lightly , but that was necessary . george mesick , the 87-year-old owner of the farm , sat in the car listening to the radio as his buffalo were shot . `` very sad , '' mesick said . `` i 'm just so glad that they got them before somebody got hurt . '' twenty-two buffalo escaped from the farm on thursday -- half the farm 's stock -- including six that were shot thursday night in rensselaer county , mesick said . one buffalo calf was found dead on a road , hit , and not reported , by a driver , mesick said . mesick has been raising buffalo for their meat since 1973 , he said , with no escape like this before . `` they love to roam , '' he said . `` they love to get in the big field and go like a son of a gun and that 's what they did yesterday . '' the last buffalo were shot 20 miles from the farm , he said . the herd broke through three strands of high tensile barbed wire to escape the farm , and later swam across the hudson river , according to mesick , still surprised . `` they never even had a pond to swim across , '' mesick said . `` i still ca n't believe it .

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- actress mindy kaling 's brother says that he posed as a black man years ago to get into medical school and that the experience opened his eyes to what he calls the hypocrisy of affirmative action . the revelation comes as vijay chokal-ingam , who is of indian descent , is pitching a book about his experiences as a `` hard-partying college frat boy who discovered the seriousness and complexity of america 's racial problems while posing as a black man . '' on his website , almostblack.com , chokal-ingam says he hatched the plan in 1998 after realizing in college that his grades were n't going to be good enough to get into med school as an indian-american . `` so , i shaved my head , trimmed my long indian eyelashes , and applied to medical school as a black man , '' he wrote on the website . `` my change in appearance was so startling that my own fraternity brothers did n't recognize me at first . '' he says he joined an organization for black students and applied to schools using his middle name , jojo . the plan had some drawbacks , said chokal-ingam , who describes himself now as a `` professional resume writer , interview coach , and graduate school application consultant . '' `` cops harassed me . store clerks accused me of shoplifting . women were either scared of me or could n't keep their hands off me , '' he wrote . `` what started as a devious ploy to gain admission to medical school turned into a twisted social experiment . '' he says it worked . despite a relatively mediocre 3.1 college grade-point average and a good-but-not-great score of 31 on the medical college admission test , chokal-ingam claims he was wooed by several top medical schools . he even posts documents on his website to bolster his claims , including an enthusiastic letter from a dean at the emory university school of medicine congratulating him on his `` excellent scores '' on the mcat . but there 's little evidence to suggest his posturing as a `` black '' applicant helped him get into these schools . first , there is no point of comparison : chokal-ingam never applied to medical schools as an indian-american . ultimately , he told cnn he applied at 22 medical schools and interviewed at 11 . he was wait-listed at four schools and got into only one . chokal-ingam eventually attended saint louis university medical school , dropping out after two years . affirmative action has been in the news a lot the past few years , with a 2013 supreme court ruling that tightened how affirmative action admissions programs have to be structured and a 2014 ruling that upheld the university of michigan 's ban on the use of race in admissions . chokal-ingam says his story shows how affirmative action `` destroys the dreams of millions of indian-american , asian american , and white applicants for employment and higher education . '' `` it also creates negative stereotypes about the academic abilities and professional skills of african-american and hispanic professionals , who do n't need special assistance in order to compete with other minority groups , '' he wrote . but a saint louis university spokeswoman disputed the account , telling the huffington post that race never played a role in chokal-ingam 's admission . `` his mcat scores and science grade point average met slu 's criteria for admission at that time , and his race or ethnicity did not factor into his acceptance into the university , '' the website quoted slu spokeswoman nancy solomon as saying . as might be expected , chokal-ingam 's claim has n't gone over well in some quarters . `` how does @vijayingam disprove the benefits of #affirmativeaction when he never gained admission to slu based on it ?

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- is america a nation divided ? and has ohio found a better way to bridge those divisions ? it 's hard not to be concerned with these questions given the constant drumbeat of news about the issues that tear us apart as a nation : immigration , community and police relations , poverty , education and dozens of other crucial matters facing america . adding to our divisions is a harsh public atmosphere where politicians are preoccupied with how they can win the next election or give the best sound bite , and where lobby groups work to protect their narrow self-interests while ignoring a broader vision of what is best for our country . in ohio , we have been able to drive meaningful change on many thorny issues that have held our state back in the past -- social services , criminal justice , economic competiveness , infrastructure -- and i 've enjoyed sharing our state 's winning formula with others in my travels . in 2011 , i returned to public service -- after earlier serving for 18 years in congress in the 1980s and '90s . over the intervening years , ohio had lost its way and was hurting . i felt called to help after knowing that members of 350,000 ohio families had lost their jobs and were looking to get back on their feet . ohio is much stronger today . and that turnaround and success are worth being excited about and sharing . for example , we have gone from 89 cents in our rainy day fund and an $ 8 billion shortfall to now having one of the nation 's strongest state budgets and a nearly $ 2 billion surplus . we 've gone from losing 350,000 private-sector jobs to creating about 340,000 new ones . we 've gone from very high taxes across the board to the largest tax cuts in of any state in america , including tax cuts for the working poor . we 're seeing wages grow faster than the national average and ohio 's unemployment rate drop to the lowest level in more than a decade . getting ohio back on track was n't easy . it required big ideas , going against the status quo and tuning out those who worry only about protecting their own special interests . yes , we have a great success story to tell about our state . and we need to make ohio 's success contagious . the leadership style that helped us turn around ohio is needed in washington , where america 's $ 18 trillion debt ticks higher each day and our congressional leaders would struggle even to pass a resolution saluting mother 's day if it required their action . great leaders are not primarily guided by polls , political parties , focus groups , re-election , special interests or protecting the status quo . instead they bring teams of people together , challenge them to innovate and engage both sides to work together to fashion solutions based on common sense and the common good . as the chairman of the house budget committee in congress in the 1990s , i helped craft the first balanced budget since man walked on the moon . we worked in a bipartisan effort that does n't happen enough . there were , of course , disagreements along the way , but they never overshadowed the shared values we had to guide our work and the shared goal of fiscal responsibility and seeing our country live within its means . given the polarizing issues facing our country , america needs a leader who believes in a common set of fundamental values necessary to bring about change that will unite our country without being blinded by the many distractions that ego , selfishness and power produce . leaders who focus only on themselves and their own good have rejected this value-driven approach and make it impossible to make progress on our most pressing issues such as balanced budgets , tax cuts , welfare reform , border security , immigration and health care . we see it every day . there are certain values that guide great countries : . \u2022 personal responsibility : it obligates us to be accountable for ourselves so we can then do our duty for our families and our communities . \u2022 empathy : it allows us to walk in someone else 's shoes , so that in times of disagreement we might consider for a moment that there might be another , better way that makes all of us stronger . \u2022 teamwork : it sets ego aside and demands that we all pull in the same direction to win . \u2022 faith : it tells us we are made special in the image of god with unique gifts that enable our mission here on earth . these values allow us to develop policy solutions that solve problems in new and creative ways for the good of all americans instead of producing rhetoric , sound bites and press releases that too often pass for true reform . in ohio we 've implemented this winning strategy . it 's worked there , and it will work for the nation as well .",

'' -rrb- and how to open the minds of people about someone everyone already has an opinion about ? same questions , no doubt , that the staff asked in 2008 when she ran against the newbie barack obama , and same questions they asked when , as first lady , she ran for the senate in new york . in that race , she ended up spending a lot of all-ears quality time in upstate new york . in this race , she could be spending a lot of all-you-can-eat time at diners , drive-ins and dives -- just like the tv show . -lrb- except guy fieri would probably have been recognized by the crowd at chipotle . just sayin . ' -rrb- . dining aside , it 's hard -- almost impossible -- to soft-launch a campaign with a superstar politician . all the gauzy ads and the small classrooms and the coffee shops ca n't mask the houdini-like effort hillary clinton is making to escape the inescapable reality -- that even her `` scooby-doo '' van is followed by throngs of press . -lrb- i half imagined an o.j. moment with a helicopter hovering as she made her way down i-80 . -rrb- . try as she might to launch with a humble start -- not entitled to anything -- she still is who she is . virtually unchallenged . not to mention famous , accomplished and controversial . in watching it all unfold , it 's hard to underestimate the task at hand . it 's also hard to figure out whether it 's actually going to work . hillary clinton -- and her experienced campaign team -- are disciplined and relentlessly on message . that 's usually a good thing when you 're running a presidential campaign . but when you 're sitting at a community college in iowa and you tick off your rationale for running and your resume -- unprompted -- it seems less effective and more oddly incongruent . -lrb- especially when the former secretary of state described her tenure in five words -- as `` standing up for our country . '' short shrift , it seems to me . -rrb- . maybe it 's that the old lessons of message discipline do n't work in the informal environment the campaign is trying to create -- at least not with this candidate . the hardest combination in politics is that just-right mixture of spontaneity and discipline . the ability to understand exactly what you have to say -lrb- over and over -rrb- and then say it as if you have never said it before . and look like you 're having a great time doing it . we like to call it authenticity , but it 's probably not . it 's a honed skill that combines connection and gravitas , both of which the voters demand in a president . -lrb- a majority of voters -- 53 % -- say they want to vote for someone who has been financially successful , as opposed to someone who has not . -rrb- so there 's this balance : if you 're too much like them , you 're nothing special to vote for . but if you 're too different , you 're not relatable . it 's a balance that does n't come easily to hillary clinton . but she 's not alone . when president george h.w. bush was running for re-election in 1992 , he was facing his own image issues . his populist challengers were calling him insensitive to middle class woes in the struggling state of new hampshire . bush tried mightily to drop the presidential persona , did some town halls , and famously declared : `` message : i care . '' some said he actually read it from a cue card , but he also said this : `` i do n't know what i have to do to convince people here that i really care about this -lrb- the economy -rrb- . i do . '' he lost . to an empathetic i-feel-your-pain bill clinton . and the rest , as they say , is history . or , in hillary 's case , at least trying to make history .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- robert downey jr. is making headlines for walking out of an interview with a british journalist who dared to veer away from the superhero movie downey was there to promote . the journalist instead started asking personal questions about the actor 's political beliefs and `` dark periods '' of addiction and jail time . twitter , of course , is abuzz : did journalist krishnan guru-murthy go too far ? must every interview be a license for a journalist to ask anything he 'd like ? from the start of the 7-minute television interview , it seems evident that downey is not particularly interested in being there , even if being there was , ultimately , a benefit to him -- after all , he 's promoting his latest film , `` avengers : age of ultron . '' he grows increasingly agitated , even as the line of questioning remains on-topic ; his attitude , meanwhile , grew increasingly smug . his eyes glaze over as the reporter talks , he makes condescending comments and gestures that seem intended to intimidate and imply he 's much smarter than guru-murthy , and he repeatedly looks toward his handler as if to say , `` do i really have to sit here with this guy ? '' at one point , he makes fun of guru-murthy for seeming nervous , saying , `` your foot is starting to jump a little bit . you better get to your next question . '' but it 's after guru-murthy asks downey whether he thinks he is `` free from all of that , '' referring to downey 's history of `` taking drugs , drinking '' that the building tension comes to a head . `` i 'm sorry , '' says downey , `` what are we doing ? '' to which guru-murthy replies , `` i 'm just asking questions , '' which indeed was so . downey has the right to refuse to answer the question , of course , but that 's not what he does next . instead , he throws the celebrity interview equivalent of a tantrum : he smiles arrogantly , says `` bye ! '' and stands up to leave . he sure showed him ! it 's true that we live in a culture where we feel we have the right to know everything about celebrities -- who they 're dating , what they 're eating , where they vacation , what they meant when they made that comment 10 years ago . journalists often go too far , even if it 's their job . and certainly not every journalist is good at his job . but while downey may be understandably tired of answering questions about his past , questions that have been asked before , his business is our business . the entertainment industry is about entertaining people . as such , we tend to like to watch actors who seem like they want to be watched . this is why most celebrities , especially those with a big budget movie to promote , agree to interviews and seek out recognition in general . but when the recognition no longer serves them ? then they want to bemoan it ? what downey seemed to misunderstand is that the interview format gives journalists the right to ask questions . that 's what an interview is . he certainly can decline to answer questions he does not feel are appropriate , or even ones he simply does n't feel like answering . but he does not have the right to be absolved for behavior that is rude , demeaning , and disrespectful -- even if he 's a celebrity , and even if he felt uncomfortable or put-off . what the video shows is a movie star with a bullying streak . after he removes his microphone and his handlers begin hustling him out with kid gloves , the actor can not resist a parting shot . he turns to the reporter , being sure to look directly at the camera on the way , and says , `` you seem okay . it 's just getting a little diane sawyer in here , '' followed by what sounds like , `` and you 're kind of a schmuck . '' downey might not have been `` in the mood '' to be questioned ... and those days , those moods , are understandable . we all have them . and yet in this case , that 's , well , too bad . the actor has agreed to an interview as part of his job . he has agreed to engage in a conversation with another professional human being . given the terms , he is not entitled to call all the shots . that he thinks he can is perhaps our own , celebrity-obsessed doing -- we revere the famous ; is it any surprise when they reveal that they , too , regard themselves as better than everyone else ? but it 's still on him .",

    "article": "washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- a new entry and a waiting game on the democratic side , a go-slow approach from a leading republican , and the big stakes of 2016 filled our sunday morning trip around the `` inside politics '' table . 1 . here 's ... bernie ! hillary clinton is about to get her first official challenger . sen. bernie sanders of vermont could make an announcement within days , reports cnn 's nia-malika henderson , adding a populist voice to a democratic race that starts with clinton as the overwhelming favorite . sanders has been exploring a run for months , and was a hit this weekend at a big south carolina democratic event . `` i do n't think he can necessarily challenge hillary clinton in terms of donors and in terms of organization , '' said henderson . `` but in terms of bringing the heat , bringing the fire , bringing that populist rhetoric , he 'll be interesting to see , and how he moves hillary clinton 's own rhetoric as well . '' 2 . for biden , watch , wait and ... few think vice president joe biden is willing to risk a third losing bid for the democratic presidential nomination . but his official word is that he is still looking at the race , and julie hirschfeld davis of the new york times reports that this `` wait and see '' approach is likely to continue for a bit . `` there is a strain of thinking that if hillary clinton 's campaign is truly to implode at some point , that democrats are going to need someone who can jump in quickly , raise a lot of money and have a lot of experience and launch a campaign , '' said davis . `` and joe biden would not mind being the person they talk about as that person . so , and as long as we are talking about that , we are still talking about joe biden , and that 's just the way he likes it . '' 3 . kasich also thinks waiting is best . ohio gov. john kasich is more visible of late , and makes no secret of the fact that he thinks he is the most qualified among the potential republican 2016 presidential prospects . but he is n't in a rush to make a formal declaration of candidacy . some see this as hesitation . but robert costa of the washington post detailed a conversation with the ohio governor in which kasich made the case that he need not rush . `` he 's not formally moving toward it right now , '' said costa . `` but i do n't think he feels a rush , because in this age of super pacs , it 's more about building donor relationships , building relationships in the early states , then maybe getting in when you have a little momentum . '' 4 . listen to the candidates -- and be reminded of the high stakes . personalities often trump policy in political coverage , especially in the early days of a campaign . but the old line `` elections have consequences '' gets repeated a lot because it just happens to be true . npr 's steve inskeep says the prospect of big changes was obvious as he did some recent homework about the 2016 race . `` jeb bush was asked this past week about president obama'a executive actions on immigration , and he said on a conservative radio talk show , ` yes , of course i would reverse them , ' '' said inskeep . `` so suddenly you are talking about millions of people who are on a path to be legalized for a while , now potentially on a path not to be legalized , depending on who wins an election . '' `` does n't mean they would go through with it . i think we all can recall president obama 's promise to close guantanamo right away if he could just replace president bush . but it certainly would color the campaign and the tenor of the campaign -- the huge changes that could lie in store depending on who wins . '' 5 . remember sharron angle ? the gop establishment sure does ! goal no. 1 for republicans in 2016 is taking back the white house . but preserving their new senate majority runs a close second -- and that will be no easy task , because so many of the competitive races are in states that tend to lean blue in presidential years . so the gop establishment is putting a priority on candidate recruitment and hoping to build on its 2014 successes , which you might recall included an aggressive effort to discourage or defeat tea party candidates viewed as too risky by the establishment . so in nevada , where democrat harry reid is retiring , there is an intensifying effort to get republican rep. joe heck to declare his senate candidacy . and in colorado , the establishment favorite is rep. mike coffman , who opened a lot of eyes with his 2014 race in a competitive swing district against a top-tier democratic opponent . those two states -- and those two seats -- have special significance in the 2016 maneuvering : reid and colorado democrat michael bennet won narrow 2010 victories in what was for the most part a big gop year . ask the establishment why , and you will get a ton of finger-pointing at the tea party candidates who emerged as the gop nominees -- sharron angle in nevada and ken buck in colorado .",

'' `` they were being disrespectful , '' added david hill , a choctaw actor . `` they were bringing up those same old arguments that dan snyder uses in defending the -lrb- washington -rrb- redskins . but let me tell you , our dignity is not for sale . '' produced by sandler 's happy madison productions as part of a four-picture deal with netflix , `` the ridiculous six '' also stars will forte , taylor lautner , steve buscemi , john turturro , nick nolte , luke wilson and rob schneider , among others . the ictmn describes the movie as a western spoof on `` the magnificent seven , '' the 1960 classic about gunfighters who protect a village from a group of bandits . the movie was co-written by sandler and is being directed by his frequent collaborator frank coraci . actors playing historical figures include david spade as general custer , blake shelton as wyatt earp and vanilla ice as mark twain , according to the internet movie database . sandler had not commented publicly on the walkout as of friday morning , although people were criticizing him in comments posted on his facebook page . `` hey adam , act like an adult for once . respect others , especially native americans , '' wrote one commenter . in a statement sent to cnn and other media outlets , netflix defended the movie as satire : . `` the movie has ridiculous in the title for a reason : because it is ridiculous . it is a broad satire of western movies and the stereotypes they popularized , featuring a diverse cast that is not only part of -- but in on -- the joke . '' the native american actors who spoke to ictmn were n't laughing , however . one , loren anthony , posted a photo to instagram from the set monday along with a comment saying , `` having a good time , great cast , great crew and feeling blessed to be here . '' but by wednesday , the navajo actor had become disillusioned and joined others in walking out . he told ictmn he felt insulted because costumes he and others wore to portray apache indians were not authentic . `` we were supposed to be apache , but it was really stereotypical and we did not look apache at all . we looked more like comanche , '' he said . according to ictmn , a native american adviser hired to help ensure the movie 's cultural authenticity also walked off the set in protest . hill , the choctaw actor , seemed to hold out hope that differences between the producers and native american cast members could be resolved . `` i hope they will listen to us , '' he told ictmn . `` we understand this is a comedy , we understand this is humor , but we wo n't tolerate disrespect .

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- when les moonves sits down at a restaurant in hollywood , it 's usually the waiter 's lucky night . as the president and ceo of cbs corp. , which includes showtime , moonves runs a powerful television network in a town where nearly every waiter also wants to be an actor . but when he walked into craig 's in west hollywood last year , those roles were reversed . this time , moonves ' waiter , gabriel salvador , was the one serving up a mouthwatering opportunity that had nothing to do with the shrimp diavolo . instead , he was offering moonves an `` in '' to the most coveted match-up in boxing : floyd mayweather vs. manny pacquiao . `` moonves ' love of boxing , our love of boxing -- that gave me the confidence to say to him ` give me a chance , ' '' said salvador , an actor who has appeared in `` bones '' and `` blue bloods . '' `` i said ' i can help you make this fight happen , ' and he looked at me like , ` okay , i 'm listening . ' '' that 's when salvador told moonves his son trained at the hollywood gym owned by freddie roach , pacquiao 's trainer , and that he would put in a good word for moonves . at that point , salvador told cnn , he was driven more by his passion to see the fight happen than any real connection to roach . but he got roach 's phone number from his son , elijah , who was skeptical of his father 's plan . everybody had already tried , his son said . but salvador made the call and gained an audience in roach . `` i said , ` listen , i can help you make this fight happen , ' '' salvador said in an interview with cnn . salvador helped set up a meeting between moonves , roach and himself at scarpetta in beverly hills that he says began with a discussion about the legacy of boxing . `` mr. moonves said to me , ` if this fight happens , you 're going to be sitting there , ' '' said salvador . salvador 's role ended after that dinner . what followed was a series of meetings between moonves and both sides that eventually ended the stalemate keeping pacquiao and mayweather from entering the same ring . the may 2 fight -- on the pay-per-view services of showtime and hbo -- is expected to gross as much as $ 600 million . with that kind of money , and a smattering of media buzz around salvador 's story , inevitable questions circulated over what , if any , reward he should get , given the epic nature of the fight . when asked to comment , pacquiao 's team downplayed salvador 's role . `` for him giving les my phone number i do n't think he deserves a finder 's fee , '' roach told cnn . promoter bob arum said salvador `` got his 10 minutes of fame , '' though he called salvador `` a really nice guy . '' salvador insists he is not seeking money , and a cbs spokesman confirmed his role in the initial meeting . `` my reward will be sitting at the fight , '' salvador said . moonves made good on that promise -- salvador will be ringside on saturday night . `` it 's about taking a chance , '' salvador said . `` it 's about putting people in touch with each other and being able to sit back and say , ` wow , i planted that seed . ' ''",

'' tamara cotman , sharon davis-williams and michael pitts also were ordered thursday to serve seven years on probation , pay $ 10,000 fines and work 2,000 hours in community service . baxter had come under fire from some community leaders for giving prison sentences to eight teachers and administrators who stood trial and were convicted of racketeering . they 'd been accused of taking part in an effort to raise tests scores at struggling schools by erasing wrong answers and putting in correct answers . outside of court , benjamin davis , the lawyer for cotman , questioned the judge 's rationale in handing down heavy sentences a few weeks ago . `` i had never seen a judge conduct himself in that way , '' he said . `` what was going on with judge baxter ? '' davis-williams said she was pleased judge baxter changed his mind . her attorney , teresa mann , added , `` we are happy . we are elated that judge baxter took the opportunity to reflect . '' cotman , davis-williams and pitts , all school reform team executive directors , got the harshest sentences during an april 14 hearing : seven years in prison , 13 years of probation and $ 25,000 fines . baxter said of his change of mind : `` i 'm going to put myself out to pasture in the not-too-distant future and i want to be out in the pasture without any regrets . '' during the earlier sentencing hearing , baxter was frustrated when defendants did n't admit their guilt . `` everybody knew cheating was going on and your client promoted it , '' baxter said to an attorney representing davis-williams . at one point he said , `` these stories are incredible . these kids ca n't read . '' at a press conference held april 17 , most of the convicted educators insisted they were innocent . `` i did n't cheat . i 'm not a racketeer , '' said diane buckner-webb , a former elementary teacher . all defendants sentenced to prison have appealed and are out on bond . the lower prison sentences given to other defendants -- ranging from one to two years -- have not been reduced . prosecutors said the cheating is believed to date back to 2001 , when scores on statewide aptitude tests improved greatly , according to a 2013 indictment . the indictment also states that for at least four years , between 2005 and 2009 , test answers were altered , fabricated or falsely certified . michael bowers , a former georgia attorney general who investigated the cheating scandal , said in 2013 that there were `` cheating parties , '' erasures in and out of classrooms , and teachers were told to make changes to student answers on tests . bowers said he heard that educators cheated out of pride , to earn bonuses , to enhance their careers or to keep their jobs . of 35 atlanta educators indicted in 2013 , more than 20 took a plea deal . twelve educators went on trial six months ago , with 11 convicted and one acquitted on april 1 . of the 11 convicted , two took a deal in which they admitted guilt , waived their right to appeal and received much lighter sentences . one defendant was giving birth during the sentencing phase not been sentenced . on thursday , baxter urged the defendants to engage in community service while they 're appealing . he said that might lighten the punishment if the convictions are upheld . the judge said he was tired of dealing with the atlanta public schools cheating scandal , which he referred to as `` this mess . '' `` i 'm ready to move on . so , anyway , adios , '' baxter said , and ended the hearing .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- much like the ardent young royal-watchers of today , enamored by the duchess of cambridge 's very being , i was similarly captivated by diana , princess of wales when i was a youngster . she was a rare breed : stunningly beautiful , immediately accessible , witty , charming and endearingly mischievous -- she was one in a million . of course that was long before the , `` there were three of us in this marriage , so it was a bit crowded , '' interviews and tell-all books alleging suicide attempts and acts of betrayal , but back then i was unaware of her more scandalous infamy . i simply adored her ... i still do . as the world awaits the impending birth of william and kate 's second baby , potential names have become the topic of rampant speculation and heated debate . girls ' names are causing the biggest stir , as there seems to be a belief that the couple are expecting a princess . if the assumptions are correct , she will be the first princess of cambridge born into the royal family in 182 years . the birth of any baby is cause for celebration , but given recent changes in the laws of succession , her arrival would be a historical one . in choosing a name , titled royals tend to turn to the family tree , rather than a well-thumbed copy of `` 1,001 best baby names '' like the rest of us . traditionally they pick dynastic names , and there are plenty to choose from : elizabeth , alice , victoria and charlotte have all been frontrunners , but the sentimental favorite among punters remains diana . in a recent today show poll , 32 % of americans predicted the name was a shoo-in , and in the uk the bookies ' odds of a baby named after her late grandmother change almost daily as diana becomes an increasingly popular choice . that said , in the event the couple do welcome a baby girl , i would hope that they do not opt to name her diana . today diana 's name is as divisive as the very institution of monarchy itself : while some have virtually sainted her , others have been vehemently critical , accusing her of being childish , unhinged and self-serving . contrary to popular belief the queen was very fond of diana , but should her name be bestowed as a first name upon the baby , it would be perceived as a slap in the face to the monarchy . in the years since earl spencer 's scathing attack on the windsors at diana 's funeral , the nation has moved on and diana 's legacy has been celebrated . she has become a part of royal history . her memory has been preserved , and the royal family is once again enjoying a renewed sense of popularity . out of respect to the queen , charles , camilla and the baby herself the couple simply would n't do it . diana 's name conjures up both positive and negative responses the world over , and whichever side of the fence you 're on , the moniker seems to me an almighty burden for a newborn baby to carry . since diana 's death almost 18 years ago , william has honored his mother 's memory in a private and personal fashion . he has taken on many of her patronages and continued to champion her causes . at his wedding in 2011 the bishop of london , richard chartres , a close friend of diana and executor of her will , gave the address . the hymn guide me o thou great redeemer , which was sung at both diana 's funeral in 1997 and at the memorial marking the tenth anniversary of her death in 2007 , was chosen for the royal wedding . julia samuel , another close friend of diana , was asked to serve as godmother to prince george . william chose kensington palace , his own childhood home , to be the primary residence for his family , and in perhaps the most public acknowledgment of his mother 's memory , he gave kate diana 's engagement ring . william does n't need to name his second-born child after his mother in order to honour her ; he does so by being a good husband and father . i still miss diana . she was a one-off , and i do n't believe the world will ever witness another quite like her . daily comparisons to her late mother-in-law are already kate 's cross to bear . should n't a baby girl be spared the same fate ? diana 's tragic , untimely death and iconic status will ensure her memory is kept alive for generations to come . she would n't want her granddaughter to languish in her shadow . she would want her to go out into the world , to make her own mark and help those less fortunate , to enrich the lives of others and to carve out her own unique identity -- as alice , elizabeth , victoria , charlotte , or -- my own personal pick -- alexandra .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- as the great kate wait of 2015 drags on , giving a whole new meaning to kate 's somewhat unfair noughties nickname , `` waity katie , '' bets on the arrival of a new baby a girl continue to be placed at a feverish rate . as of today , 70 % of those laying down their hard earned cash are convinced the world is on the verge of welcoming a new princess . i suspect different parties are hoping for a girl for different reasons . based on the so called `` kate effect '' and subsequent `` george effect , '' the great british high street is no doubt salivating at the prospect of record sales should hrh princess -lrb- fill in the blank -rrb- of cambridge be spotted in one of their outfits . as one headline blared this week , `` baby girl could be worth $ 1.5 billion to the country . '' magazine and newspaper editors are well aware of the dramatic rise in sales when a royal baby hits the cover , especially a little girl . and then there 's disney , which will always appreciate princesses in the zeitgeist , but as with all things relating to the monarchy , there is also a far greater historical significance should a baby girl arrive . there have been 34 kings and only six queens over the course of the british monarchy 's thousand-year history , and yet some of the nation 's most enlightened times have occurred when a queen has been on the throne . elizabeth i led the country through the golden age , and victoria and elizabeth ii -- the two longest reigning monarchs -- both made their mark with perhaps the most illustrious and progressive legacies of all . while it is unlikely this child will ever be crowned , as the daughter of the second-in-line to the throne , her role will be significant . prince charles has made no secret of his desire to slim down the monarchy , but in looking at his family 's immediate bloodline -- william , harry and george -- it stands to be a heavily male-dominated one . in an institution viewed by some as archaic and out of touch , it is imperative to have a strong female presence . princess anne -- baby cambridge 's great-aunt -- grew up with three brothers , and was once described as , `` the greatest king the country never had . '' she is patron of more than 200 charitable organizations and carries out some 500 public engagements a year . a noted equestrian , she won two silver medals and a gold at the european eventing championships , and was the first member of the royal family to compete at the olympics . more importantly she has supported her mother throughout her reign , flown the flag for britain and promoted brand windsor around the world . as the only girl born to elizabeth and philip , she has matched and often surpassed the accomplishments of her brothers . princesses beatrice and eugenie , also true blood princesses , are not `` working members '' of the royal family and generally only roll out for state and ceremonial occasions . so , yes , it would be nice for the baby to be a girl so that we can all ooh and ah over frilly dresses , fairy wings and ballet shoes -lrb- although as a windsor she 's more likely to be mucking out stables and shooting pheasant -rrb- , but in truth the birth of a girl matters on a far deeper level : the monarchy needs a baby girl to fill the female void of future generations . the 20th century was ushered in by queen victoria and the 21st by queen elizabeth ii . should george live to eighty-seven he will be the first monarch of the 22nd century , but as i have said before the british monarchy is anything but predictable . if punters are right and william and kate do announce the birth of a baby girl as the rightful `` spare , '' it 's certainly possible that a seventh queen may ring in the year 2100 . in the event the couple welcomes a boy , however , i sincerely hope there wo n't be a collective groan of disappointment heard around the world -- after all on the few occasions we have seen prince george he has been a veritable treat . the birth of any baby is cause for celebration regardless of gender , race , religion or indeed status , and as prince harry , the world 's most eligible bachelor has shown , games of naked billiards can sell magazines too . read more : please do n't name the royal baby diana .",

'' they separated after going to therapy for about six months and jenner began taking female hormones and removing his hair through electrolysis . as he started developing breasts , his children began to notice -- a claim that jenner also made in his interview . thompson says jenner did not remain a presence in their lives after he married kris kardashian , mother of kim , khloe , khourtney and rob kardashian . together , the couple had two children , kendall and kylie . thompson said she forgives jenner for those years . he has already `` been held prisoner in his own flesh '' and hopes that his life will get easier now . in addition to `` world 's greatest athlete , '' she hopes people will remember him as `` trailblazer for the civil rights of the transgender community .

'' after she was abandoned at birth , long-time hong kong expats tina and rog thomas began fostering mui , when she was just one and a half years old . they were told she did n't have long to live . `` we wanted to give her a family life in the time she had , '' says tina . however , mui began to thrive in a loving family environment and tina and rog formally adopted mui when she was three years old . together they gradually learned how to manage her skin condition . each day she bathes twice , ideally for two hours each time , and everywhere she goes she carries a backpack with three or four tubs of cream that she must apply throughout the day to stop her skin from drying out . she 's thought to be the fourth oldest person alive with harlequin ichthyosis . the oldest is 31 . but while mui 's unusual appearance made little difference during her early years , that changed when she started secondary school . the school she attended required that she be accompanied by a educational assistant , which put up a barrier between her and the other children and made it difficult for her to make friends . things got worse when she became a victim of cyberbullying . she began to deny her appearance , stopped bathing , taking her medication and applying the cream . at times , she considered jumping from the balcony of her home . `` they 'd say things like ` you should n't have been born ' -- and very personal things that only people who knew me would know , '' she says . `` it made me very wary of everybody . even when people tried to be nice , i did n't repay it . i did n't trust them . '' the worst episode lasted for 10 months and only stopped after police became involved and found the bully -- someone whom mui thought was her friend . mui left school with no qualifications . she says the school did n't push her to study and made too many allowances for her skin disorder . `` i still wish i had got a very hard kick up the backside from the teachers when i was n't doing work , '' says mui . since leaving school , mui has found a full-time job working with people with special needs and at weekends can be found running around a rugby pitch with a whistle -- she 's a referee for kids ' matches . along with her parents , she 's also begun speaking about her experiences of living with a `` visible difference '' and cyberbullying at schools around hong kong . her father has also written a family memoir called `` the girl behind the face . '' many have found her story inspirational -- a real life version of the young adult novel `` wonder '' by r.j. palacio about a young boy with a deformed face who enters middle school . on saturday , she will graduate from school assemblies and speak in front of a paying audience at a tedx talk in the city . her father is both protective and proud . he thinks public speaking will help mui come to terms with her condition but he 's also wary that she could be portrayed as a `` modern freak show . '' `` it 's difficult for her because she spent so long denying it . the more she confronts it , the more she is aware of it -- it will build confidence , '' he says . there 's even talk she might take part in a fashion show for people with visible difference , realizing a childhood dream . in person , mui comes across as articulate , poised and confident -- something her mom says comes out of spending so much time with adults while growing up -- and it 's easy to see how she could command an audience of hundreds . but after two hours of chatting in a coffee shop , she 's a little bored and keen to get back to her job . she flings her backpack over her shoulder and dashes off into hong kong 's crowded streets .",

'' haftar did not respond directly when he was asked whether libyan authorities would confront any european forces within its territory . `` the european union needs to stand with the libyan people to solve the crisis instead of taking such decisions , '' the general said . `` the migrant crisis affects them . but why do n't they see that our problems are also very important ? it 's important for them to support us either on the humanitarian front or on the security front . '' pressed on the point , haftar replied , `` we do what 's in the interest of the libyan people . the european union is looking after its own interests so we will also look after ours . '' but he said libya is open to other kinds of cooperation on the issue of migration . `` if they take the right approach , we will certainly cooperate , '' he said , referring to eu authorities . `` the appropriate approach will benefit libya and its fight against terrorism . and i repeat , that means lifting sanctions against libya -- specifically those against the army .

'' that next flight , which will be the seventh spacex commercial resupply services mission to the space station , is not scheduled to take off before june 19 , nasa said . meanwhile , russian flight controllers continue their efforts to make contact with progress 59 as it passes over russian ground stations . nasa said tuesday that russian flight controllers had `` confirmed that the vehicle had entered into a slow spin and have issued commands to attempt to control it . '' according to russian state news agency tass , six attempts to make contact were to be made wednesday . the u.s. supplies on board the spacecraft include spare parts for the station 's environmental control and life support system , backup spacewalk hardware and crew clothing , `` all of which are replaceable , '' nasa said . u.s. astronaut terry virts , from maryland , is the current space station commander . cnn 's eliott c. mclaughlin , suzanne presto and amanda barnett contributed to this report .",

'' mocha likes to suck on fleece blankets and has been known to eat rubber ear buds or hair elastics , but nothing like a pile of jewelry , parkinson said . her breeder wondered if the dog was acting out of anxiety . that day , parkinson had left mocha in a different apartment the couple owns that the dog was n't as used to . the breeder told parkinson that dobermans are particularly known to get anxious and do these sort of things . `` she had a dog that actually consumed her whole dog bed , '' parkinson said . from now on , parkinson said she will put mocha in a crate if the dog will be staying somewhere new . follow-up x-rays monday on mocha showed a few pieces of metal left , `` but they were moving along '' and the vet expected her to pass them naturally . parkinson said friday mocha was `` her playful , energetic , curious doberman self . '' but now that she thinks of it , the timing of this whole incident is a little suspicious . `` my husband was all excited about the new apple watch , but could n't justify a reason to purchase it since he owned three watches , '' she said . `` i am convinced that he and mocha joined forces here to destroy all of his current watches in order to make room for apple 's new watch .

'' the study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level . in 2012 , 8 percent of americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers . despite the increases in heavy drinking , the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time , researchers found . madison county , idaho , reported the lowest rate of binge drinking in 2012 , at 6 percent , while menominee , wis. , had the highest rate , at 36 percent . hancock county , tenn. , had the fewest heavy drinkers -lrb- 2 percent of residents -rrb- and esmeralda county , nev. , recorded the most -lrb- 22 percent -rrb- . related : 1 in 5 high school girls binge drink . about 88,600 u.s. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010 , the researchers note , and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $ 220 billion per year . the increase in binge drinking does n't surprise terri fukagawa , clinical director of the new life recovery centers in san jose , calif. , where 15 of her 24 treatment beds are filled with clients primarily addicted to alcohol . she said she 's seen more people seeking treatment for alcoholism in the past four years . still , she noted , `` there are a lot of people still out there needing treatment , but they wo n't come in unless they have a consequence like losing a job or -lsb- getting -rsb- a dui . they think they have control over it . '' public health experts offer a number of cultural and economic explanations for the increase in excessive drinking . as a result of changed social norms , it 's now more acceptable for women to drink the way men traditionally have , said tom greenfield , scientific director at the alcohol research group at the oakland , calif.-based public health institute . young people are more likely to binge drink , and affluent people have the money to drink more . so the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like san francisco , san jose and oakland -- many in hard-working , hard-partying tech jobs -- may have helped spur significant spikes in drinking rates in the bay area and similar communities , experts said . taxes on alcohol have not risen along with the consumer price index , so wine , beer and liquor have gotten cheaper over time in real dollars , he said . alcohol advertising , particularly for hard liquor , has increased in recent years . a federal trade commission study found that companies spent about $ 3.45 billion to advertise alcoholic beverages in 2011 . alcohol control policies , such as limits on when and where alcohol can be sold and how long bars can stay open , have weakened in past decades , greenfield said . that may partly explain rising consumption nationwide , particularly in some states where `` blue laws '' once prohibited alcohol sales on sundays or in supermarkets . to conduct the study , researchers analyzed data on about 3.7 million americans aged 21 and older from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system , an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors conducted by the u.s. centers for disease control . kaiser health news -lrb- khn -rrb- is a nonprofit national health policy news service .",

'' many family members , across generations , live in the same house and will use the drugs together as `` a community activity , '' duwve said . and this has led to more needle sharing , which spreads infection . she said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade . another reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself . opana , as the prescription opioid is known , needs to be injected more than once a day . duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence . when people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours , they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal . often they 'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms . the other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood , which increases the risk of infection . health leaders worry about the spread of hiv and other diseases such as hepatitis c around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown . there has been a 150 % increase in hepatitis c between 2010 and 2013 , the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers , the cdc said . `` the situation in indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down , '' mermin said . `` this is a powerful reminder '' that hiv and other infectious diseases `` can gain ground at any time , unless you remain vigilant .

'' since mid-december , 16 states have seen bird flu turn up in commercial poultry , backyard chickens , and in flocks of wild and captive wild birds , according to the cdc . that number will likely grow as birds with the disease fly from one state to the next . on monday , health leaders in iowa said more than 5 million hens would have to be euthanized after bird flu was detected at a commercial laying facility there . in the united states , some 3.5 million birds had already been euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease , according to the usda . iowa has about 60 million laying hens , according to the iowa egg council and is the top egg producer in the country . california and minnesota , two of the country 's top 10 egg producing states have also seen cases . the news is bad for the birds , but not for humans . the cdc considers the likelihood of bird to human transmission of the virus `` low '' according to dr. alicia fry , a medical officer with the cdc national center for immunization and respiratory disease , influenza division , epidemiology and prevention branch . `` that said , human infections have occurred '' with another strain of the virus , found in africa and in asia , so the cdc can not rule out the possibility of human infection , fry said . `` we are cautiously optimistic '' that it wo n't spread to humans , but `` we are prepared for the possibility , '' she added . they are studying the current virus and creating candidate vaccines which could be used if one were ever needed . the usda is also working on a potential vaccine for the birds . these are typical routine public health preparedness measures . the cdc said it is also monitoring at least 100 people who have worked with sick birds . none of the workers have gotten sick themselves . most of the people who have become infected with the other strains of the virus in asia and africa have had direct or prolonged contact with infected birds . the virus does not spread through people eating chickens or eggs . birds that are sick die quickly , according to clifford . incubation period is three to five days generally . with turkeys , they go off their water and their feed when they are sick and become lethargic or have a condition called `` torticollis '' or `` stargazing '' he said , and they die shortly after that . farmers also see a drop in egg production . commercial growers have taken extra precautions to disinfect vehicle tires and any equipment that comes into contact with the birds . workers must also disinfect their shoes and hands when they go from building to building to reduce contamination . with popular backyard birds , the usda suggests people try and protect their animals from coming into contact with wild water fowl that may carry the virus . the cdc said , as with any evolving public health situation , they will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available . the good news is the virus does n't like warm weather or strong sunlight , according to the usda . so the cases should go down over the summer , but they are going to monitor the situation knowing that it could come back in the fall .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- when the earthquake hit , many of nepal 's most renowned pagodas in and around kathmandu crumbled into rubble-covered stumps . others were smothered under splintered hand-carved wooden beams or multi-level rooftops . but the kathmandu valley 's other pagodas , stupas and shrines -- also built mostly of red brick hundreds of years ago -- suffered surprisingly little damage and remained standing next to structures which disappeared . the worst architectural losses have included the majestic shiva temple pagoda and its twin , the narayan temple pagoda , which dominated kathmandu 's main durbar square . from the late 1960s onwards , western hippy backpackers who traveled the legendary overland route to kathmandu would climb the shiva pagoda 's wide , nine-step plinth , sit in the shade under the triple-layered roofs , smoke hashish and enjoy the lofty view . but now the two pagodas have been obliterated and the scene comprises pathetic piles of rubble , a bulldozer shoveling a path for vehicles , shocked and miserable witnesses and a sense of irreplaceable visual and spiritual loss -- unless the structures are eventually rebuilt . the shiva temple pagoda may have been hundreds of years old , but before its destruction impoverished rickshaw drivers , coolies and others would publicly urinate into the gutter surrounding it while waiting for passengers or heavy loads to transport . the slightly shorter , triple-roofed narayan pagoda allowed vegetable sellers to display their foodstuff on the temple 's broad , five-level base . both pagodas also served as public platforms . jostling crowds of nepalis and foreigners used to gather there because the plinths ' height above street level allowed excellent views of major hindu processions and other events . those two landmarks fronted the enclosed dwelling place of nepal 's hindu virgin goddess , or kumari , whose ornate front of bricks , statues and carved wood seem to have survived the initial quakes . it is not immediately known if the inner courtyard and rooms are safe . on the other side of durbar square , the brick-and-wood shiva-parvati temple house -- where the hindu gods shiva and his consort parvati shelter -- appear to also have survived . on kathmandu 's outskirts the town of patan suffered terrible damage when its central durbar square lost several pagodas as structures pancaked straight down while others merely shook and cracked . fortunately others appear to still be standing , including the sundari chowk temple and a surviving lucky trio of holy structures : the gray stone , mogul-influenced krishna mandir ; the 17th-century bishwa nath mandir with its large stone elephants at the entrance ; and the nearby smaller 17th-century bimsen mandi `` god of the traders '' pagoda . several miles away from kathmandu , witnesses have been unable to immediately confirm the levels of destruction which have occurred in the lavish town of bhaktapur . the locality had undergone years of extensive restoration work thanks to foreign and local artists and funding . the town offset some of that cost by charging tourists a fee to enter its central area , which displayed refined temples , pagodas , shrines and even a restaurant built into a main pagoda , allowing diners to view the best sites while munching their meals . elsewhere in the kathmandu valley , the white-topped dome of the boudhanath stupa remains standing , but its smaller neighboring stupa has shown some damage from the quake . the boudhanath stupa is prized by tibetan buddhist refugees who have fled their chinese-occupied homeland on foot through the himalaya mountains . they are often seen reverently walking in a circle around the stupa 's base while twirling `` prayer wheels '' and chanting . there has been no news as yet on damage caused to other famous places of hindu and buddhist worship , including the hilltop swayambhunath temple on the outskirts of kathmandu . that imposing structure is popularly known as the `` monkey temple '' because its often vicious wild monkeys are allowed to scamper among the trees on the temple 's hill , terrifying visitors who have to hike up a lengthy stairway to reach the temples , shrines , shops and monks ' residences . . the fate of the pashupatinath temple complex near kathmandu 's international airport is also not known . pashupatinath 's multiple pagodas and shrines flank its public funeral pyres which emit smoke whenever human corpses are routinely cremated before the ashes are dumped into a narrow river .",

'' then the german insisted his race was hampered when he found himself sandwiched between race leader hamilton and vettel , both of whom had stopped for fresh tyres a few laps earlier . `` lewis is driving very slowly . tell him to speed up , '' rosberg told the mercedes pit wall . mercedes then instructed hamilton on the team radio : `` ok lewis we 'd like to pick the pace up a little bit . '' rosberg complained after the race that hamilton 's lackadaisical sunday driving was holding him up , pushing him back into vettel 's thrall and taking life out of his tyres . `` it 's interesting to hear from you lewis about your pace up front , '' rosberg said in the post-race media conference . `` that was compromising my race . driving slowly , that was unnecessary , and meant sebastian was closer to me . `` it cost me a lot of time ... i 'm unhappy about that of course .

'' then , after a brief but well-timed pause , he added , `` which is surprising , because usually , the only people impersonating journalists on cnn are journalists on cnn . '' obama was nailing his own punch lines frequently , and perfectly . then , to up the ante on his time at the podium , he welcomed his `` anger translator '' -- a recurring character played by keegan-michael key on comedy central 's `` key & peele . '' it was a clever surprise , and the crowd reacted with surprising enthusiasm -lrb- i would n't have presumed most of them knew of key 's character or his series -rrb- , though key 's jokes lost something in the translation , and did n't pack the punch of obama 's . but the bit ended with a great twist : obama himself getting so worked up about a snowball being carried into congress to denounce global warming that the president 's `` anger translator '' had to calm obama down instead . and then came cecily strong , with a sly opening line referring not only to her appearance as one of the few female guest speakers at the correspondents ' dinner , but to the upcoming 2016 presidential election . `` feels right , '' she said , `` to have a woman following president obama . '' from there , the crowd seemed as tough as advertised , with `` oohs '' often as loud as laughter , as strong went from one target to another . she even got `` oohs '' when her targets were outside the room , as when she said , noting how obama has aged visibly in office , `` your hair is so white now , it can talk back to the police . '' but the seemingly tepid response to strong 's routine may have been partly due to the late hour . she came on after not only the dinner service and obama , but after scholarship awards , correspondent awards and tributes and other bits of official business . and her routine was n't over until 11:08 p.m. -- making it a longer tv show than even the emmys . before the main event finally began , c-span filled the time scanning the room with its cameras , but providing only ambient sound with very few identifying voice-overs or prerecorded features . once in a while , you could see someone recognizable in the large , oddly eclectic crowd : tea leoni , ivanka trump , larry wilmore , jane pauley . for the most part , though , it was like playing a frustratingly difficult beltway game of spot-the-face-in-the-crowd -- a sort of `` who 's waldo ? '' and after a few hours watching a gaggle of people chat and eat , all i wanted to do was go home . and i was already home . but i stayed tuned , just so i could watch , and grade , the results . final tally : obama gets an a - , keegan-michael key a c , cecily strong a b - , and the entire telecast and event an a + for democracy -- but a d as television .",

'' the visit was highly anticipated because it would have marked kim 's first official foreign trip since inheriting the leadership of north korea in late 2011 . he was to have met with russian president vladimir putin as part of the may visit to coincide with victory day , marking the 70th anniversary of the soviet union 's victory over nazi germany in world war ii . kim also could have had the chance to rub elbows with the heads of about 30 other governments , including the leaders of china , cuba , india , germany , vietnam and venezuela . this number represents about half the world leaders that russia has said it invited to the celebrations . kim 's trip had been anticipated since late december , when russian state media reported that moscow had extended an invitation . there was no further explanation , from moscow or pyongyang , as to why he would n't head west . still , north korea has a number of issues it 's been wrestling with for years . they include widespread poverty , its longstanding spat with neighboring south korea and the united states , as well as its international isolation largely due to its controversial nuclear program . and news about kim 's non-visit comes a day after south korean intelligence agents told lawmakers that kim is ruling with an iron fist , having ordered the execution of about 15 senior officials so far this year . cnn can not independently confirm the executions detailed by shin kyung-min , a lawmaker with the new politics alliance for democracy who attended the closed briefing . and the nature of the intelligence supporting the allegations was not immediately clear . that said , north korea is one of the most closed societies in the world . and there 's little doubt that kim is very much in charge . according to shin , intelligence officials say the north korean leader is ruling in an impromptu manner and does not countenance excuses or any views that vary with his own . cnn 's madison park and alla eshchenko contributed to this report . cnn 's matthew chance reported from moscow , and cnn 's ed payne and greg botelho wrote this story from atlanta .",

'' she 's also put off by the congested traffic and the high cost of parking . if shanghai 's extensive subway system does n't take her where she wants to go , she uses a popular uber-like taxi app -- or rents a car . she 's not alone . a recent report by consultants bain & company suggested that even though china 's love affair with the car began late , it may already be souring . of 2,137 people it surveyed , some 40 % said cars were losing their appeal as a status symbol . gu says luxury cars like bmws and mercedes are still an important way to `` show face '' among many of her friends . `` if you 've been working for 10 years and do n't have a car , people might wonder if you have financial problems , '' she said . but she prefers to spend her money on other things like traveling abroad . `` i do care about face but there are other ways to show it .

'' at that moment , the officer or deputy becomes an identifiable target whose whereabouts are available to any one of waze 's 50 million users worldwide . social media has made enormous contributions to law enforcement as a `` force multiplier '' that lets citizens help police protect our communities . as we have seen with the emergence of crimes like identity theft , however , technology has the potential for evil as well as good . in the case of waze , we are confronted with a tool that can be lethal to police officers and deputies , whose roles in society are to protect our citizens and enforce the laws that keep our communities safe . google , whose stated mission is `` to organize the world 's information and make it universally accessible and useful , '' is now marketing an app with the potential to obstruct law enforcement and put the lives of police officers and deputies at risk . even the more benign uses of waze 's `` traffic cop '' feature are concerning . in 2013 , 10,076 people were killed in alcohol-related automobile accidents . and in 2011 , 9,944 people lost their lives in speed-related fatal crashes . is the highest , best use of google 's geo-mapping and crowdsourcing capabilities to help drunk drivers avoid checkpoints and give speeders assistance in evading speed limits ? it 's not just the speeders and drunk drivers who have access to the locations of police officers through google 's technology . perpetrators of domestic violence can use it to find out about the presence of law enforcement in a spouse 's neighborhood ; gang members , narcotics dealers , even those intent on perpetrating an act of terror , all have access to waze 's `` traffic cop '' feature . google has built a solid reputation as a good corporate neighbor , tying for first place in a 2013 study by the reputation institute measuring companies ' reputations for corporate social responsibility . the company makes much of its compliance with legal , moral and ethical obligations as a good corporate neighbor . but when it comes to waze , google has gone into a defensive crouch . the company 's executives flat out refused to discuss the subject with representatives of the national sheriffs ' association , an organization representing more than 3,000 sheriff 's offices across the united states . the refusal of google 's executives to even dignify our concerns by meeting with us offends our conscience . if google 's real objective is the `` common good out there on the road , '' it will work with us to ensure the safety of both motorists and police officers . the goals are not mutually exclusive : we can have both .",

'' sledge never saw a dime of songwriting royalties . he had some regrets about that , he told blues and soul magazine -- the song would have helped provide for his children -- but he accepted it . `` worst decision i ever made . but i am not at all bitter . i figure if god wanted me to do what i did , and say what i did to tell those guys they could have the song , then i 'll leave it that away , '' he told the magazine . `` when a man loves a woman '' became a standard , covered many times -- michael bolton took it to no. 1 in 1991 -- and featured on several movie soundtracks . it was even the title of a 1994 film starring andy garcia and meg ryan . sledge 's version also returned to the charts , hitting the uk top 10 in 1987 . even with his other hits , he said , it all came back to `` when a man loves a woman . '' `` the granddaddy to all of my songs . the boss of all of my songs . i have great respect for that song , '' he told blues and soul . `` always will . '' sledge was inducted into the rock hall in 2005 . his death was followed two weeks later by that of another '60s soul legend , ben e. king , who had an enduring hit in 1961 with `` stand by me . '' people we 've lost in 2015 . cnn 's john newsome contributed to this story .",

'' chris nashawaty , entertainment weekly : `` no one forks over 10 bucks to see one of these flicks for its logic . we go for the bananas demolition-derby mayhem . ` furious 7 ' delivers that with the direct visceral rush of an epipen . for two hours and change , we 're treated to a high-octane orgy of some of the most exhilarating stunts ever put on film , including one showstopper where walker balances on an overturned bus that 's teetering on the edge of a cliff . '' chris ziegler , the verge : `` it 's entirely possible , of course , that my fandom has simply blinded me to ` furious 7 's ' greatness . the action sequences -- particularly abu dhabi , with the supercar leaping between buildings -- are legitimately phenomenal , and the scenes filmed after walker 's passing , in which his brothers stepped in for him , were never distracting or even noticeable without looking closely . maybe i 'm missing something . '' a.o. scott , new york times : `` the final moments , when mr. walker 's longtime colleagues say their farewells while he still appears to be on screen with them , are both awkward and moving . they remind you what these movies have always been about , underneath all the noise and the bravado : the ferocity of friendship and the terrible speed of loss .

'' at the bottom of the list was jetblue , which offered the lowest percentage of award seats and the fewest number of award tickets of the five biggest u.s. airlines : 892,000 one-way passenger tickets , or 4.5 % of its total 19.7 million u.s. seats . -lrb- jetblue only operates in 10 of the top 25 markets included in the study . -rrb- . many jetblue customers fly the airline only once or twice per year , making it hard to accumulate miles , an airline spokesman told the magazine . by not allowing miles to expire anymore , the airline says customers will be able to eventually redeem them . delta air lines came in second place with 5.6 million u.s. award seats ; united airlines ranked third with 5 million u.s. award tickets ; and american airlines was fourth with 3.5 million u.s. award seats . what are the world 's safest airlines ? remember that award tickets are n't actually free . the cost of miles is built into everything you buy that 's earning you miles , and the airlines profit from you not using your miles at all . so it behooves consumers to book award travel carefully . on average , nearly 10 % of passengers on the five airlines analyzed by consumer reports flew on domestic award tickets , but some of them were n't getting the best value for their miles . while many u.s. fliers redeemed miles on american airlines flights from los angeles to san francisco , the cheapest average fare on that route was just over $ 100 -- not worth the 12,500 to 30,000 miles needed for an award ticket , consumer reports says . better to use them on american airlines ' route between new york and san francisco or delta 's route between chicago and los angeles , which are generally more expensive than that los angeles-san francisco route , according to consumer reports ' calculations . while award-seat availability is important , it may not matter as much as passengers ' overall satisfaction with an airline . southwest had the highest customer satisfaction score -lrb- 86 -rrb- , followed by jetblue -lrb- 85 -rrb- , delta -lrb- 70 -rrb- , american -lrb- 66 -rrb- and united -lrb- 63 -rrb- . and do n't forget the fees . southwest does n't charge any fees , while other airlines tack on fees for checking bags , booking by phone , changing plans and more .",

'' as smile attempts to pour tea , the other seven children in this household run around the courtyard . the first wife remains unseen in the house . a portrait of gulnaz 's liberator in 2011 , the then-president hamid karzai , hangs on the wall . but the sense of order here is undermined by the fact that this is a house built around a crime . how gulnaz ended up here requires some explanation . there was pressure upon her to marry her attacker after her release . but at the same time , other activists were trying to assist her with an asylum bid abroad . `` unfortunately , gulnaz was heavily pressured to marry her attacker by various people within the government which , in and of itself , was immensely disappointing , '' her former attorney , an american citizen named kimberley motley , tells us . `` gulnaz was constantly told that neither she nor her daughter would be protected if she did not succumb to their pressure to marry ... gulnaz essentially became a prisoner of her environment . `` as an uneducated , young , single mother with no family support , it would have been an uphill battle for gulnaz and her daughter . '' local pressure won out . she was introduced to her attacker in the shelter where cnn first interviewed her upon release from prison . they talked and it was agreed she would marry him . most disturbingly , the woman who -- despite knowing the stigma it would create around her -- defiantly insisted she had been raped when we spoke nearly four years ago , now says she was told by her relatives to make up the allegations . `` now she is beside me and knows that it was not as big as they had shown it , '' says asadullah . `` no i am not thinking about it anymore , '' gulnaz adds . `` i do n't have a problem with him now and i do n't want to think about the past problems . my life is ok ... i am happy with my life ... it is going on . '' she is then permitted to talk with us alone . asadullah moves away but stands close to the door of the room . though she now maintains she was not raped , she explains her decision . she contradicts her husband , saying her brothers would have taken her back , had she not married him . `` my brothers opposed the marriage and told me to take my daughter and go to pakistan to live with them instead , '' she says . `` but now we 're married , they disowned me and wo n't see me again . '' her decision was for her daughter . `` no , i could n't fulfill my wishes in life . i married this man ; i cut relations with my family only to buy my daughter 's future . '' it is truly chilling to see how things have gone for gulnaz after the level of international attention her story received -- pregnant with the third child of the man who was once her rapist , accepting a life as his second wife , trapped in his home .",

'' this idea to create a fresh perspective drove him into the desert of western sahara , a long-disputed region of northwestern africa . thorpe uses the area 's harsh landscape as a powerful backdrop for soldiers posed as green plastic figurines -- similar to the popular toys that many children play with . the soldiers are with the polisario front , an independence movement that has been clashing with morocco over the region since the mid-1970s . thorpe said his project enables `` the creation of a visual metaphor from which a viewer develops their own emotional , physical and political response to war and conflict , when faced with the realization that the images do not contain toy soldiers but real soldiers . '' thorpe 's background was not in photojournalism , but in landscape photography , which lends to his powerful placement of the soldiers in the desert -- not to mention that all the locations chosen are historic locations of battles between morocco and the polisario front . `` the conflict in western sahara receives virtually zero coverage despite 2015 being the 40th anniversary of the outbreak of war there , '' thorpe said . after a ceasefire in 1991 , the people of western sahara have been living in a state of non-resolution . the people are split into two camps -- those living in moroccan-occupied territory , and those in refugee camps in algeria . social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . thorpe had to get clearance to work with the polisario front military and also had to be cautious of how many troops he moved about at one time -- otherwise he would have needed permission from the united nations . he usually worked with about 50 or 60 soldiers at a time . the autumn months did not offer much reprieve from the long hours in the sweltering desert sun . thorpe would work with the troops ' commander to position the men , then climb atop sandy mountains with his wide-angle lens and capture these striking images . they would work till dusk and then spend the night under the stars . not only were the soldiers willing participants for this project , but they also helped construct the platforms they stood on . thorpe said they were made out of old oil drums . after the elaborate five-week production , thorpe hopes his images will raise questions on `` how images of war -lrb- will -rrb- be consumed in the future with ever-diminishing attention spans and competition for them .

'' the actual number of children who were kidnapped and killed did not change -- it 's always been a relatively small number -- but awareness of the cases skyrocketed , experts said . but the news industry was expanding to cable television , and sweet images of children appeared along with distraught parents begging for their safe return . the fear rising across the nation sparked awareness and prompted change from politicians and police . in 1984 , congress passed the missing children 's assistance act , which led to the creation of the national center for missing & exploited children . president ronald reagan opened the center in a white house ceremony in 1984 . it soon began operating a 24-hour toll-free hot line on which callers could report information about missing boys and girls . cnn 's lorenzo ferrigno and joe sterling contributed to this report .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- this weekend , millions of people are expected to tune in to watch two men beat each other up . why is this ? we 'll explore , but first let 's get something out of the way : the big fight between manny pacquiao and floyd mayweather wo n't `` save '' boxing , a sport that has fallen precipitously since its 20th century heyday . if anything , the so-called `` fight of the century '' just reinforces the sport 's problems , as two aging heroes collide in what might be the last nationally relevant fight for a very long time . there 's so much wrong with boxing 's business model , but all you really need to understand is this : most sports fans probably ca n't name a single active boxer after mayweather and pacquiao . some might know that the long-reigning heavyweight champ is a towering ukrainian with a boring jab-happy style , but most would n't come up with his name -lrb- wladimir klitschko -rrb- . boxing is n't fading away because we 've finally awoken to its brutality but from a combination of catastrophic mismanagement and competition from mixed martial arts -- a younger , more dynamic and better-managed competitor . the rocket rise of mma 's premier organization , the ultimate fighting championship , has matched boxing 's equally dramatic decline . in the course of just two decades , the ufc has grown from a freaky-violent carny sideshow into a mainstream sport . in fact , the fan base of the ufc now rivals that of the world 's most popular fighting sport : ice hockey . some aficionados spin elaborate defenses of the hundreds of fist fights that break out every year in nhl games , claiming they make the game safer by punishing dirty play . but that 's so weak . everyone knows why the nhl has n't cracked down on fighting hard enough to end it : fans love it way too much . as the hockey announcer don cherry once said , `` when -lsb- legendary tough guy -rsb- bob probert was fighting , did you ever see anyone get out of their seat and go get coffee . '' but why do we like to watch fights in the first place ? over the past 20 years , i 've watched boxing and mma in a spirit of nervous fascination . watching fighters kick , punch and strangle each other , i 'd be thinking , i 'm a civilized person . i appear not to be a sociopath . so why am i watching ? what 's wrong with me ? and what 's wrong with all of us ? who among us has n't felt the giddy , guilty thrill of a fistfight breaking out -- whether in a schoolyard , a hockey rink or a prize ring ? we all claim to hate violence , but i think we protest too much . inside us all , there 's a creature that adores it . how else are we to explain our yen for carnage in rough sports , films , gory video games and literature ? so is that it ? are we drawn to a big fight like mayweather-pacquiao simply by bloodlust and barbarism ? actually , i think that 's only part of the story , and not the biggest part . if we just wanted blood and pain , we would n't bother with the tame violence of pay-per-view fisticuffs . instead , we 'd fire up a web browser and watch isis snuff videos for free . but many people who feel no temptation to watch internet snuff feel sorely tempted to watch a big fight . what 's going on ? there 's a great literature on boxing , with contributions from writers such as ernest hemingway , norman mailer and joyce carol oates . for them , boxing is n't really a sport . you ca n't play boxing like you can play tennis . they compared boxing to a rite , or a religion , or above all to theater , complete with spotlit performers improvising on an elevated stage . a fight was drama sweated down to the bones -- a metaphor for the whole human condition , with everything noble and ugly on display . while it may seem like a stretch , i think we are drawn to prizefights less to revel in what 's dark and nasty in human nature than to honor what 's good and noble . prizefights set up conditions of dramatic adversity that evoke what we admire most in human beings : extremes of courage , grace , fortitude and even heroism . so should we feel virtuous as we watch mayweather and pacquiao 's epic brain damage contest ? i would n't go that far . perhaps such spectacles really should , as most of the world 's medical societies insist , be abolished . most of us feel ambivalent toward prizefighting because we should . a fight puts the darkest stuff in human nature on display : the bared fangs , the blood , the frenetic drive to do harm . but all that dark stuff draws out the best stuff , and turns a great fight into a showcase for the indomitability of human will . when mayweather and pacquiao clash at center ring on saturday night , the good angels of human nature will yearn to turn away -- and to lean in .",

'' `` we had predicted it will be rejected because clemency is a prerogative right of the president , as head of the government , not an object of a suit at the administrative court , '' he said in a message . `` with this decision , it 's a step closer towards the scheduled execution . '' australia has repeatedly appealed for clemency for the pair and has unsuccessfully proposed a prisoner swap with indonesia as a way of avoiding their deaths . indonesia has long taken a hard line on drug smugglers , and since assuming office in october , widodo has made it clear he intends to be tough on those found guilty of such crimes . in an interview with cnn 's christiane amanpour in january , he said there would be `` no compromise '' on drug dealers . `` indonesia is in a drug emergency , so we need to have something that 's firm , '' said widodo . `` they can ask for amnesty from the president . ... but i 'm telling you there will be no amnesty for drug dealers . '' in december , six prisoners convicted of drug offenses were killed by firing squad , including five foreigners from brazil , the netherlands , malawi , nigeria and vietnam . chan and sukumaran have been jailed since april 2005 for a failed bid to smuggle more than 8 kilograms of heroin from bali to australia . the bali nine were arrested after indonesian police received a tip from australian federal police . chan , 31 , was called the ringleader of the plot , while sukumaran was described as chan 's collaborator . seven other people who participated in the plan are serving lengthy prison sentences . police caught four people at the denpasar airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies . another four -- including sukumaran -- were arrested at a hotel in the village of kuta . chan was detained after boarding a plane to sydney ; he was n't carrying any drugs but was named by others as the mastermind of the plot . opinion : why executions wo n't win indonesia 's drug war . sukumaran and chan have become model prisoners during their time behind bars , according to fellow inmates and the jail 's chief warden . sukumaran is studying fine arts and has set up a class for fellow inmates . chan has found spirituality , which he uses to counsel inmates with drug problems . australian foreign minister julie bishop has said that their rehabilitation is genuine . australians have shown public support for the men , with politicians and members of the public turning out for a dawn vigil to demonstrate opposition to the planned executions . australia lodges formal complaint over bali nine transfer . cnn 's euan mckirdy contributed to this report .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- would you want a tv program about your family history to include details of a distant , long-deceased relative who had owned slaves ? seriously , who in their right mind would want to be tarnished by the sins of an ancestor you had no connection to other than a remote bloodline ? i would n't , and neither did ben affleck , who lobbied producers of a pbs show , `` finding your roots , '' to remove any reference to his great-great-great grandfather benjamin cole , a georgia slave owner in the mid-1800 's , in an episode that looked at affleck 's family history . -lrb- affleck revealed cole 's name wednesday night . -rrb- . here 's the thing that might surprise many , given the tendency of the media to exploit any potentially scandalous material : the show 's producer , harvard professor henry louis gates jr. , apparently acquiesced to affleck 's request , because when the episode aired in october 2014 , there was no mention of the star 's slave-owning ancestor . affleck 's attempt to alter the content of the program only publicly became known a few days ago after wikileaks released hacked emails revealing an exchange between gates and sony pictures chief michael lynton . when gates asked how he should respond to affleck 's request to delete the material , lynton responded , `` all things being equal , i would definitely take it out . '' and on tuesday , affleck , via facebook , admitted that he had urged gates to excise any reference to his slave-owning relative . affleck explained , `` i did n't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves . i was embarrassed . the very thought left a bad taste in my mouth . '' now gates has publicly denied that he made his decision about the content of the program based on affleck 's request , but it seems likely that he did . after all , affleck noted as much in his facebook post , writing that gates `` agreed with me on the slave owner but made other choices i disagreed with . '' and three other celebrities profiled on the series last season were shown to have been related to slave owners . so it 's unlikely that it was simply happenstance that it left out any reference to affleck 's familial slave ownership connection . in any event , pbs has launched an internal review to determine if the show violated its own editorial standards . whatever the results of the review , affleck and gates did the right thing . let 's be clear : `` finding your roots '' is not an investigative news show ; it 's an entertainment program . in fact , as affleck noted , much of the material is provided directly by the celebrity being profiled . it 's not `` 60 minutes '' but more in the nature of a sophisticated profile of celebrities , using their marquee names to attract viewers . there 's not even a hint that affleck strong-armed the producers or made any type of threats against them if they included the information . in the emails between gates and lynton , which they presumably believed at the time were confidential and would remain so , there was no mention of undue pressure by affleck . instead , gates simply noted that affleck `` asked us to edit out something . '' after the emails were revealed , gates issued a statement , saying , `` ultimately , i maintain editorial control on all of my projects and , with my producers , decide what will make for the most compelling program . in the case of mr. affleck we focused on what we felt were the most interesting aspects of his ancestry -- including a revolutionary war ancestor , a third great-grandfather who was an occult enthusiast , and his mother who marched for civil rights during the freedom summer of 1964 . '' my view would be different if affleck had a history of uttering racist remarks or engaging in racist conduct . that would have made the information truly newsworthy . but instead we have a man known for championing progressive causes , which i 'm sure made him even more acutely sensitive that some on the right might possibly use this information against him in the future . perhaps that 's what affleck meant in his facebook post when he wrote that this information made him feel `` vulnerable . '' affleck has noted that he regrets asking pbs to not include information about his `` distant relative . '' that 's a nice gesture , but it was not needed . affleck had every right to ask for the information about a long-deceased distant relative to be left out of the show . and pbs had the choice to include it or leave it out . i applaud pbs for doing the right thing at a time when media outlets rarely show any restraint on the lives of people in the public eye .",

'' loeb says he met the actress in 2010 and they got engaged two years later , at which point they decided to create the embryos and conceive a child via a surrogate . after two attempts failed to bring fertilized embryos to term , they created two more embryos using her eggs and his sperm . `` when we create embryos for the purpose of life , should we not define them as life , rather than as property ? , '' he said . '' ... a woman is entitled to bring a pregnancy to term even if the man objects . should n't a man who is willing to take on all parental responsibilities be similarly entitled to bring his embryos to term even if the woman objects ? '' loeb said he filed a complaint against the 42-year-old actress to prevent her from destroying their two embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization . he filed it in august in santa monica , california , where they apparently lived while they dated . `` we signed a form stating that any embryos created through the process could be brought to term only with both parties ' consent . the form did not specify -- as california law requires -- what would happen if we separated , '' he said . '' i am asking to have it voided . '' representatives for vergara have declined to comment in the past . loeb has said he believes `` life begins at fertilization '' and wants to implant the embryos in a surrogate and bring them to term . he said he does n't want any money from the egg donor . the case has led to questions about who has the right to embryos . typically , a prior legal agreement between a couple spells out who has ultimate authority , said fertility specialist dr. david tourgeman , who 's not involved in this case . `` usually when embryos are created , whether the couple is married or just consenting adults , there 's usually a power of attorney that is described to these embryos , if they are frozen for future use , '' he said . in most cases , the mother or the origin of the egg is given power of attorney , although anyone can make a request , tourgeman said . if there 's a disagreement , the courts usually get involved to decide who legally owns the embryos , he said . vergara is now reportedly engaged to actor joe manganiello .",

    "article": "tripoli , libya -lrb- cnn -rrb- smugglers lure arab and african migrants by offering discounts to get onto overcrowded ships if people bring more potential passengers , a cnn investigation has revealed . a smuggler in the libyan capital of tripoli laid bare the system for loading boats with poor and desperate refugees , during a conversation that a cnn producer secretly filmed . the conversation , recorded using a mobile phone , exposes the prices and incentives used to gather as many migrants as possible onto ships . an estimated 1,600 migrants have died so far this year on the dangerous mediterranean crossing , but still more wait to try to reach europe . cnn 's producer was introduced to a senegalese and malian smuggler by an intermediary in tripoli , who mistakenly thought she was a syrian looking to bring other syrian refugees with her onto boats to italy . why i fled : migrants share their stories . the smuggler took her to an unfinished building on the outskirts of tripoli near the city 's many ports , where the migrants they have already found are kept until the crossing is ready . the building could only be reached by walking down a trash-littered alleyway , and featured a series of packed rooms , separated by curtains , where dozens sat -- well over the 80 migrants she was promised would be in her boat . the smuggler explained that the `` final price '' for syrians -- often thought to be richer than their african migrant counterparts -- was $ 1,000 . he added that for each syrian she brought with her , the producer would get a $ 100 discount . so if she brought 10 , she could travel free . he explained how the `` discount '' was `` well known , '' suggesting perhaps it was part of the unwritten rules that govern the trade and why so many migrants come to each boat . any fears about the crossing were supposed to be allayed by the smuggler insisting the boats they used had new motors , and that the senegalese pilot would have a satellite telephone and gps to assist the crossing . he also assured cnn 's producer , when asked , that if the people became too many , they would use two boats . pregnant women among migrants trying to cross .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- would you build a house with water ? hungarian architect matyas gutai believes that water is the perfect material for keeping a house at a comfortable temperature . and while that does n't mean that he can do away with traditional materials like bricks , cement , and plaster , his system promotes a whole new idea of engineering . gutai built a prototype house in his hometown of kecskemet , south of budapest , with his high school friend milan berenyi , after years of research and development . the house was built with a grant from the eu , and showcases the `` liquid engineering '' concepts gutai has written about extensively . panels , some of steel , and some of glass , make up the structure of the house and a sheet of water is trapped between the inner layers , which equalizes the temperature across the building . the house is actually able to reheat itself , when its hot excess heat is stored either in the foundations of the building or in external storage , to be brought back to the walls when the temperature drops . the indoor temperature can also be modified using a monitoring system similar to central heating . this is a very efficient and sustainable system : the house can produce its own energy and be more independent of energy suppliers , which could reduce carbon emissions . `` our panel can heat and cool the building itself -- the water inside the panel does the very same job as heating , '' says gutai . `` it saves energy , when you compare it to a similar building with large glass surfaces -- it 's a very clean and sustainable solution . '' while studying sustainable architecture at the university of tokyo , in 2003 , gutai got the idea for his water house from a visit to the open air hot baths . despite the snowfall outside the pool , gutai remained comfortably warm inside it -- it was then he realized the importance of water 's surface temperature and its potential use in architecture . `` as an architect i think it 's really important that this building tries to redefine permanence , which has been a key concept in architecture for thousands of years . our approach to permanence has n't changed much at all , but now instead of making something very strong that tries to resist everything , we are making something that adapts to its environment . `` architecture is really changing in our time . we 've reached our limits when it comes to solid architecture , now it 's reasonable to look for a new system . '' `` this research dates back seven or eight years , '' explains gutai . `` i started it at the university of tokyo and it took us almost six years to get the building done . there are plenty of structural problems involved -- a lot of important questions were raised such as what happens if it 's so cold outside that the water freezes or what happens when one panel breaks . '' `` we now mix the water with natural solvents , that do not cause pollution but lower the freezing temperature to an acceptable level . this practically means , that even if the reheating technology fails , the water can not freeze . '' `` in case of cold climates , like in hungary , we also add some external insulation to the structure , to protect it from freezing . '' and if a panel were to break ? `` we designed special joint units . the joint elements allow slow flow , but block faster flows , '' he explains . this means that if one panel breaks , it will be sealed from the remaining ones instantly . this effect is based on fluid dynamics , and not computers or monitoring system -- which minimizes the chance of failure . gutai has worked in cooperation with universities and manufacturers to make sure the building is viable , and while the prototype house is only a small space -lrb- eight square meters in total -rrb- it demonstrates the power of this new technology . `` our goal should be to use less energy and materials , and take cities off-grid as much as possible . the water house is one way to do that , '' said gutai , who currently works as a researcher at feng chia university in taiwan . constructing houses in this way is moderately more expensive than traditional designs , but this prototype aims to slash our energy needs and gutai is working with factories and companies across europe on projects using this technology . to make water the building material of a greener future .",

'' but rather than mourn the loss , scientists held a briefing to celebrate the mission 's success . `` for the first time in history we now have real knowledge about the planet mercury that shows it to be a fascinating world as part of our diverse solar system , '' said john grunsfeld , associate administrator for the science mission directorate at nasa headquarters in washington . one of messenger 's big findings : it sent back data indicating that ice in mercury 's shadowed polar regions , if spread over an area the size of washington , would be more than two miles thick , nasa said . it also took some amazing photos of the planet . so the messenger mission is ending , but scientists say they 'll be busy for years studying data from the probe . and if you want to see mercury with your own eyes , you may be in luck if you can find an area with dark skies . it will be visible in the night sky just before dusk until about the end of may . your favorite astronomy website will have some helpful guides . here are a few we found : . \u2022 earthsky.org . \u2022 astronomy . \u2022 sky and telescope . \u2022 stardate .",

    "article": "rome -lrb- cnn -rrb- a destination for the destitute , sicily is the `` promised land '' for thousands of migrants and refugees making the desperate journey from north africa to europe 's mediterranean coast . more than 10,000 people have arrived from libya since last weekend alone , according to the italian coast guard . stories of death at sea and unimaginable suffering are nothing new in the waters between north africa and italy ; boat people have been arriving on italy 's islands for more than a decade . but what makes the current influx different is the increase in numbers and the absence of control from the ports of embarkation , specifically those in libya , because when moammar gadhafi was in control , he also controlled the flow of migrant ships . in 2008 , the-then italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and gadhafi signed an historic friendship agreement in which italy promised to invest $ 5 billion in libyan infrastructure and gadhafi promised to close what he described as a `` spigot '' of migrants . during a three-day state visit to italy in august 2010 , he famously threatened to `` turn europe black '' if libya did not enjoy cordial relations with the european union . after the agreement , gadhafi kept his promise and the number of arrivals drastically decreased . for a time , almost all migrant arrivals came from tunisia , just 70 miles from the italian island of lampedusa . because italy sent most of those migrants who did not qualify for political asylum back to tunisia , the flow eventually tapered off . and once a new tunisian government was in place , after the arab spring , italy signed an accord with tunisia in which they promised to help patrol tunisia 's ports . but after gadhafi was overthrown , the flow of migrants from libya exploded again : the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- in rome told cnn that more than 140,000 migrants arrived from the north africa coast in 2011 . in october 2013 , after a tragic boat accident off the coast of lampedusa in which 349 people -- including an infant still attached to its mother by the umbilical cord -- died , trapped like sardines in their smugglers ' boat as it sank , italy decided it had to act . in november of 2013 , the italian navy launched a $ 9m-a-month search-and-rescue program called mare nostrum , in which italian naval ships patrolled the seas to rescue migrants . in just one year , the program rescued more than 160,000 migrants , according to the italian navy . due to budget constraints and criticism from the european union that the program itself was encouraging migrants to head across the mediterranean , the mission ended in october 2014 . by the end of the year , more than 174,000 people had been rescued in italy ; an estimated 3,072 people died making the journey , according to the iom . in november last year , the european union 's border control , frontex , started its own mission -- triton -- with a budget of less than a third that of mare nostrum . frontex has no vessels or surveillance equipment of its own , so has to rely on european member states to lend them ships ; a ship from iceland , at the far north of the continent , is currently involved in frontex 's operations off southern europe . when italy ended mare nostrum , the u.n. high commissioner for refugees antonio guterres warned that some european governments were making `` keeping foreigners out a higher priority than upholding asylum standards . '' `` this is a mistake , and precisely the wrong reaction for an era in which record numbers of people are fleeing wars , '' guterres told a unhcr policy meeting . `` security and immigration management are concerns for any country , but policies must be designed in a way that human lives do not end up becoming collateral damage . '' once migrants arrive in italy , they are supposed to be processed for political asylum and monitored until it is granted or denied , but italy has been sanctioned by the european union for not fingerprinting new arrivals . by law , italy has to take care of the arrivals , but many have no intention of staying in the country , and few of the reception centers are gated , meaning migrants can come and go as they please . and with no physical border controls between italy and other european countries , they can then disperse across the continent . moutassem yazbek , 27 , an it specialist who worked for six years in dubai , arrived in sicily in december on board a smuggler 's boat . he told cnn he was never fingerprinted in italy , and eventually made it to germany where he is studying to learn the language and find work . he says the human trafficking network is a finely-oiled machine that fills a growing need . `` i would have done anything to get here , '' yazbek said . `` it was worth the risk , the bad treatment and the fear . hard as that may be to believe , it is a better life .

'' oatway says he tried to get as close as possible , conscious that the attackers were aware of his presence . `` when the attack started i was 20 meters -lrb- 65 feet -rrb- away , but at one point i was 4 or 5 meters away , '' he said . `` i did think that maybe they would leave him alone . '' the attackers finally did move on and leave sithole alone . oatway and his fellow journalist beauregard tromp quickly put the injured man in the back of the car and rushed him to a hospital , where he later died . `` i still remember him looking straight into my eyes , '' said oatway . `` he had a kind of a dazed , shocked look in his face . '' oatway 's series of images of the ordeal landed on the front page of south africa 's sunday times under the headline , `` kill thy neighbor : alex attack brings home sa 's shame . '' it 's a shame that south africa continues to confront . seven people have been killed in the latest round of xenophobic violence against poorer immigrants , many from south africa 's neighbors . xenophobic attacks : how did we get here ? local media alleged that the attacks were a consequence of zulu king goodwill zwelithini reportedly saying at a recent gathering that foreigners `` should pack their bags and go '' because they are taking jobs from citizens . shortly after his reported comments , violence against immigrants erupted in the port city of durban . but on monday , zwelithini said he had not called for a war on immigrants . `` this war i am calling for today is to protect everyone of foreign origin in this country irrespective of which country they are from . '' the united nations said the attacks actually began in march after a labor dispute between citizens and foreign workers . opinion : labeling south africa violence as xenophobia misses the point . but it was oatway 's photos of the violent attack on sithole that have seemingly encapsulated the true horror of the situation -- and south africa 's leaders have begun to take notice . `` terrible picture . people who live in rough townships have never seen such a scene , '' said president jacob zuma about the photos in a televised news conference . `` and i was sitting and i was saying to myself , what are we telling the world about ourselves ?

'' his plea for help comes the day after iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi met with u.s. president barack obama in washington to seek more support for the fight against isis . `` just allah knows if we will survive this , '' essawi said . according to the anbar official , at least 10 iraqi security forces were killed and more than 100 others were wounded in the fighting against isis on wednesday . the extremist group 's offensive in ramadi shows its resilience despite months of u.s.-led airstrikes and its recent defeat by iraqi forces in the northern city of tikrit . isis fighters have ramadi under pressure from several angles . essawi said isis militants made significant advances wednesday in three areas east of ramadi : albu soda , albu ghanem and parts of soufia , which leads to central ramadi . later , he said that militants were rolling into the center of ramadi . over the weekend , the militants seized control of areas north of ramadi . routes south of the city were taken some months ago . that leaves only areas to the west of ramadi in the hands of government forces , but those positions are under threat , essawi warned . the recent fighting has driven a steady stream of refugees out of the city . on wednesday , some residents packed what they could into metal carts as they prepared to flee on foot . people also were fleeing the areas where isis was advancing east of ramadi . at least 150,000 people have already fled since wednesday morning , causing huge traffic jams on the roads leading outside the city , according to essawi . a cnn team met with three families that had fled an isis assault in the albu ghanem area . those families said iraqi security and military forces withdrew from albu ghanem after a battle with isis , which took over the area quickly . one fleeing albu ghanem resident , abu ahmed , paused to talk to cnn as he and his family walked east toward baghdad , crossing a bridge over the euphrates river . he said four isis militants had entered his house and set up a sniper position on his roof . abu ahmed said he , his wife and four children walked away from the home with his elderly mother while the isis fighters were busy setting things up there . he said his family left everything behind . his family was using a cart to carry his mother , who could n't walk . while talking about the fighters ' takeover of his home , his wife started crying and asked god to help the rest of the families who are stuck in albu ghanem . ramadi has seen intense and persistent fighting for months . isis took over parts of the city in the first half of last year , placing it at the heart of a deadly tug of war ever since . the u.s. military has carried out multiple airstrikes against isis targets near ramadi in recent weeks . `` the coalition has been supporting the fight in ramadi with airstrikes , and there have been seven airstrikes in ramadi since monday , '' col. ed thomas , spokesman for joint chiefs chairman col. martin dempsey , said on wednesday . he stressed that ramadi remains contested . another u.s. military official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , told cnn that the fall of ramadi is `` not imminent .

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- north korea is in the headlines again . according to a wall street journal report thursday , chinese nuclear experts have told the united states that pyongyang may already have as many as 20 nuclear warheads . and while that number may seem stunning , it is actually only part of a troubling story . the key takeaway from the latest assessment of north korea 's nuclear capability is not in the actual number of warheads , but the type of warhead , as this gives a better clue to the future of the country 's weapons capabilities . true , the reported chinese estimate of 20 warheads is large enough to constitute a nuclear `` arsenal . '' however , this number is not actually significantly larger than conventional open source estimates of 10 to 15 warheads previously provided by u.s. and other experts . the big takeaway from the report is instead the prediction that north korea could be in a position to double its arsenal by next year with weapons-grade uranium . if that assessment is correct , and pyongyang can indeed boost its nuclear stockpile by the end of this year to around 40 warheads by utilizing highly-enriched weapons-grade uranium , then the plutonium program that the u.s. and members of the six-party talks had been negotiating over this past quarter century would suddenly seem trivial . after all , the plutonium program might be capable of spitting out maybe a few weapons worth of plutonium annually . this news could be much more serious . why ? for a start , it would mean that north korea 's activities would undoubtedly meet the definition , if it had not already , of a runaway nuclear weapons program , with the potential to be fueled by a large supply of raw uranium buried in north korea 's mines . in addition , while the plutonium program at yongbyon has a clear and detectable profile , the thousands of centrifuges that spin in a uranium-based program have no detectable heat signature or topographic profile , meaning you could store the stuff not just in the labyrinth of underground tunnels in north korea , undetectable from the sky , but in any large warehouse . washington and seoul have tended to have a policy that leans toward downplaying north korean threats , at least when there is n't a full-fledged crisis going on . for example , the united states downplayed north korea 's missile threat until the country successfully put a satellite into orbit in december 2012 . and up until 2006 , no one thought the kim regime would actually dare undertake a nuclear test . these new estimates could therefore be a timely reminder that we may have downplayed the threat north korea poses once again . but thursday 's report is n't the only troubling information we have had recently . just as concerning is the norad commander 's assessment on north korea 's missile capabilities . on april 7 , adm. bill gortney said during a press briefing that the defense department believed pyongyang 's kn-08 intercontinental ballistic missile -lrb- icbm -rrb- is operational , with a warhead capacity . this statement is troubling for two reasons . first , gortney 's statement , when combined with the latest chinese assessment , implies that north korea now not only has nuclear weapons , but the ability to miniaturize such weapons for a warhead that could be placed atop a missile with range rings extending to the u.s. mainland . second , and just as importantly , pyongyang 's advances in mobile icbm capabilities could end up undermining the state of stable deterrence that currently exists on the korean peninsula . put simply , these capabilities could give north korea confidence that it is immune from any u.s. counterstrikes . and if that ends up being the case , the united states could find itself with a renewed headache in asia -- and its carefully calibrated plans for its pivot to the region crumbling .",

'' the recent surge is not isolated in new york ; other states across the country have noticed similar trends . alabama department of public health issued a statement last week acknowledging a rise of synthetic marijuana usage and said there had been 98 overdoses suspected to be linked with `` spice '' in the previous month . mobile county alone has seen seven cases in 2015 so far , more than the entire previous year , the statement said . mississippi health officials are also concerned that synthetic marijuana is on the rise . ninety-seven cases over an eight-day span in april were reported to the mississippi poison control center , a department of health press release said .",

'' the government had accused gao of disclosing a highly confidential `` document no. 9 '' issued by the ruling communist party leadership in 2013 to an overseas chinese-language news organization , according to her lawyer . the document revealed the party 's ideological battle plan to counter advocates of constitutional democracy , banning public discussions on topics ranging from press freedom , civil rights to judicial independence . `` there is no defense against state secret charges in china , anything the party or the government want to label as state secrets will be labeled and treated as such -- they can even do it retroactively , '' said nicholas bequelin , the hong kong-based east asia director of amnesty international . `` her sentencing is in line with the very stern approach president xi jinping 's team has taken on dissent , information control and challenges to the party , '' he added . beijing police detained gao in late april of last year -- ahead of the sensitive 25th anniversary of the tiananmen square crackdown -- and state broadcaster cctv soon aired her `` confession '' on national television . expressing `` deep remorse '' in the video , gao told interrogators she `` deeply regretted that her behavior had harmed national interests and violated the law . '' mo , her lawyer , said the authorities had extracted the confession by threatening her son 's safety and released the police video to cctv without her knowledge . he added the alleged recipient of the leaked document even publicly denied that gao was his source . an outspoken journalist and press freedom advocate , gao began her career as a reporter for the state-run china news service in 1979 and , in recent years , had been writing columns for overseas chinese-language publications . she was arrested after the tiananmen square protests in 1989 and released more than a year later . she was imprisoned for another six years for leaking state secrets in 1993 -- though the government has never disclosed details of that case . since xi took power over two years ago , his government has jailed hundreds of activists across china despite rising international concern . `` we are in the midst of one of the most severe crackdowns on human rights activists , '' said bequelin of amnesty international . `` what the state used to tolerate , it does n't tolerate anymore .

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- just before writing this column , i reached into the depths of my wallet , and in between the pilot licenses , i slid out a postage stamp-size certificate issued by the federal aviation administration . the certificate documents my successful completion of the dc special flight rules area , or sfra , online course . the online course verifies that i am knowledgeable to fly a plane under visual flight rules into the most highly restricted u.s. airspace in the country . although a `` no-fly zone '' over the white house has long existed , the sfra airspace was developed to protect the washington area further after the 9/11 terrorist attacks . the size of the sfra airspace is designed to be large enough to give our defense forces enough time to determine if a threat exists from an aircraft entering it , an opportunity to identify the threat , and if necessary , to divert or eliminate it . an airspeed restriction begins at a 60-mile radius from the center of reagan national airport . at the 30-mile radius , all aircraft must file a flight plan that identifies itself to air traffic control via a specific four-digit transponder code -lrb- a transponder is an electronic communication device that identifies a specific airplane on an air traffic controller 's display screen to indicate authorization for the flight -rrb- . aircraft must enter the sfra through specific flight `` gates '' that are displayed on a standard aviation map . aircraft on instrument flight rule flight plans , which include all airline operations , are not required to comply with sfra restrictions . air traffic control assumes the responsibility for the appropriate routing . as a matter of standard procedure , flights using an instrument flight rule flight plan have specific clearances with specific transponder codes , so the authorization for transit through the sfra airspace is already built into the system . why do i carry the certificate as an airline pilot ? i have had occasion to fly my own little airplane through the airspace on a visual flight rule flight plan . pilot who landed gyrocopter blogged about why . noncompliance with the airspace requirements , or worse , no communication at all , carries some serious federal penalties , which could include the suspension or revocation of your pilot license . being at the wrong end of an f-16 missile is also a possible penalty . so how does a flying machine that looks like a sophisticated lawn chair with helicopter blades invade such highly restricted airspace , as happened wednesday , when a postal carrier from florida landed a single-person aircraft on capitol grounds ? well , i 'm making an assumption based on the video footage , but it appears that this aircraft is classified by the faa as a gyrocopter . a gyrocopter can not quite launch straight up into the air in the manner of a typical helicopter ; it requires a short ground run for takeoff . and most gyrocopters are kit-built aircraft . it also appears that this particular gyrocopter may weigh just under 255 pounds , which classifies it as an ultralight aircraft in faa parlance . why is weight significant ? below that weight , a license for the pilot or a license for the aircraft is not required . in addition , to remain in the classification , the maximum designed airspeed ca n't exceed 55 knots . lawmaker looking into gyrocopter landing as pilot goes to court . a facility tracking the movement of this particular gyrocopter on radar would witness a speed probably attainable by the average canadian goose . and the radar reflection on a piece of machinery of that diminutive size is most likely very limited . if it was actually tracked on a radar screen , the target may have appeared to be a flock of birds . how much damage could this aircraft have inflicted had it been intended for nefarious purposes ? well , if it had been crashed into a building , i feel confident that the building would have been triumphant . if the intent had been to carry some sort of destructive device , the weapon would have had to be relatively small . the engine is not designed to carry more than one pilot . and lack of carry-on space is a definite issue . not that a review of airspace security measures is n't in order , but i would n't be concerned that this event will become the next threat epidemic . as an airline pilot , i can say i am relatively confident that our nation 's capital is secure from gyrocopter attacks orchestrated by misguided lunatics .",

'' the proposed training materials , overseen by appointed federal monitor peter zimroth , were submitted to manhattan federal court judge analisa torres on monday for approval . they include directives to `` not tell or tolerate ethnic , racial or sexist jokes '' and to `` not imitate the speech patterns '' of others . `` do not engage in racial profiling , '' the training materials read . `` it is against the law . it violates fundamental democratic precepts and freedoms . it violates this department 's policies . it is offensive . it violates your responsibility to treat people equally . it diverts us from catching real criminals . it alienates us from people who need us , and hurts our ability to do our job . you can probably think of other reasons not to do it , but the point is that you will not do it . '' the training notes also instruct new cadets `` not to use terms or words that devalue groups of people or stereotype them '' and `` not to imitate speech patterns of other racial , ethnic and class groups when communicating cross culturally '' because `` they appear disingenuous , artificial , and possibly racist . '' the revised training notes , which include 140 pages of instruction and powerpoint slides , are a result of a 2013 federal ruling declaring the new york police department 's `` stop , question and frisk '' practice unconstitutional . the nypd has said the policy -- in which police stop , question and frisk people they consider suspicious -- was used to deter crime . the practice had been widely criticized . police department figures showed that nearly nine out of 10 people `` stopped and frisked '' in 2011 were african-american or hispanic , though new york mayor bill de blasio has said 90 % of those stopped were innocent . `` the current training materials had not undergone a comprehensive review for some time ... -lsb- and -rsb- did not address some important subjects or account for some changes in nypd policies and law , '' zimroth wrote in a cover letter to torres . `` all parties agreed it was essential that the materials be rewritten for the current class to reflect current law and policy . '' the nypd collaborated with zimroth 's team in crafting the final training materials . they will now `` review their implementation in terms of our current and ongoing practices , '' said an nypd spokesperson in an email to cnn . the patrolmen 's benevolent association declined to comment . the materials also provide historical legal information on proper `` stops '' and offers detailed procedures for patrolling buildings for criminal activity . they also give instructions on how an officer should lawfully conduct him or herself when engaging with the public . `` remember that a courteous , professional and respectful police officer who illustrates the opposite of bias and discrimination helps create a partnership with the community and builds rapport with the people in it . `` the result is that the citizens become our allies and , in turn , policing becomes safer and easier . this enhances our effectiveness and increases our pride and pleasure in what we do , '' the notes read . if approved , the new training materials will be integrated into the class curriculum for the current class of cadets . they are expected to graduate in june .",

    "article": "shanghai , china -lrb- cnn -rrb- when china 's biggest auto show opens in shanghai this week , the only models on display will be the ones with four wheels . gone , show organizers hope , will be the scantily-clad `` car babes '' that in previous years have posed provocatively on car hoods and sashayed through the aisles to draw crowds to the 9-day event . the focus , instead , will be the latest offerings from an array of global car manufacturers , which -- models or not -- are pulling out all the stops to compete for chinese customers in what since 2009 has been the world 's largest car market . `` it 's a major industry event for us , '' said andrew boyle , global product communications manager at rolls royce . it sells several hundred of its super-luxury vehicles in china each year , and in shanghai this week will launch its latest model , the phantom limelight . vehicle sales in china totaled 23.5 million units last year , almost a third more than in the united states . however , the show comes at a turning point for china 's auto market , which is facing a second year of slower growth in 2015 after a decade-long sales and production frenzy . intense competition for china 's drivers means that car manufacturers are increasingly developing vehicles that cater to chinese preferences . nissan will use auto shanghai 2015 to unveil the lannia mid-size sedan , which it says has been specially created for `` the rising young chinese generation . '' the country 's gearheads have embraced the suv or sport utility vehicle , sales of which jumped a third last year , and many will feature in the displays planned by dozens of european , japanese u.s. , south korea and chinese automakers . this year mg , once known for its sleek sports cars and now owned by shanghai automotive industries corp , enters the fray with its first suv , the gs , while ford will give two new luxury suvs their china market debut -- the lincoln mkx and lincoln navigator , the latter favored by hip hop stars . `` the suv is popular as a first car , '' said raymond tsang , a shanghai-based partner at consultancy bain & company . `` if you only have one , you want one that you can commute in and take on a road trip . '' foreign brands have dominated sales in the past two years , but as they improve product quality and design , local rivals like geely , which also owns sweden 's volvo , and great wall motor are clawing back market share , especially when it comes to suvs . geely , which already exports to russia , the middle east and africa , is also stepping up its efforts to crack more developed markets . it is preparing to export the volvo s60 inscription to the united states from a factory in the southwestern city of chengdu . it would be the first car made in china to hit u.s showrooms and may pave the way for chinese brands to shake up the u.s. market like japanese and korean car manufacturers did decades earlier . with car ownership still at much lower levels than the u.s. and europe , china is likely to remain the industry 's most important market for decades . however , the breakneck growth may be a thing of the past . in 2014 , growth in sales halved to 7 % and according to the china association of automobile manufacturers , the slowdown continued in the first three months of this year when sales rose just 3.9 % . it comes as the wider economy slows and a prolonged campaign against corruption has hit sales of luxury vehicles , especially brands like audi that have been the ride of choice for chinese officials . on top of that , the hassles of car ownership are deterring some potential buyers , as is an awareness of the environmental costs . congested and chaotic roads , restrictions on the number of new vehicle license plates and a shortage of residential parking space may trigger a backlash against car ownership , according to a recent report from bain & company . `` the car was seen as a status symbol , '' says pierre-henri boutot , a partner at bain and co-author of the report . `` but now in larger cities they see the hassle and some of these people are thinking of giving up their car . '' just maybe , china will need those car babes to boost sales after all .",

    "article": "bangkok -lrb- cnn -rrb- thailand has lifted martial law , replacing it with it a controversial new security order granting sweeping powers to the ruling military junta . critics have expressed alarm at the move , with human rights watch 's asia director brad adams saying it marked the country 's `` deepening descent into dictatorship . '' martial law was lifted wednesday when the thai king bhumibol adulyadej approved a request from prime minister general prayuth chan-ocha to proceed . prayuth -- head of the national council for peace and order -lrb- ncpo -rrb- junta -- immediately invoked article 44 of the country 's interim constitution `` to curb acts deemed harmful to national peace and stability . '' article 44 states , in wide-ranging terms , that when the head of the junta believes it is necessary in the name of public harmony or to prevent the undermining of national security , then he has the power to act as deemed necessary . according to a statement issued by the ncpo , the new order grants military personnel powers to issue summons and arrest those who commit crimes against the royal family or against national stability , who commit crimes involving war weaponry , or who violate the orders of the ncpo . designated military personnel were granted powers to seize assets , to block media from reporting or publishing , and to detain suspects up to seven days , the statement said . unauthorized political gatherings of more than five people were banned , while those who defied ncpo orders could be imprisoned for up to a year , it said . those who were detained could not leave the country without the approval of the head of the ncpo . human rights watch said in a statement that the new security order would allow prayuth `` to issue orders without administrative , legislative , or judicial oversight or accountability . '' `` thailand 's friends abroad should not be fooled by this obvious sleight of hand by the junta leader to replace martial law with a constitutional provision that effectively provides unlimited and unaccountable powers , '' adams said in a statement . sunai phasuk , human rights watch 's senior researcher on thailand , told cnn the move would see prayuth `` become a strongman with ultimate power in his hands to wield as he wishes . '' `` this is a dangerous indication that the junta is not going to keep its promise to restore democracy and respect for human rights in thailand , '' he said . rupert abbott , deputy director for asia pacific at amnesty international , called in a statement for the ncpo to `` reinstate the rule of law and constitutional protections for human rights which the 2014 coup steamrolled over . '' meanwhile , the united nations high commissioner for human rights zeid ra'ad al hussein expressed alarm at the news . `` normally i would warmly welcome the lifting of martial law -- and indeed strongly advocated for it to be lifted in thailand , '' the high commissioner said . `` but i am alarmed at the decision to replace martial law with something even more draconian , which bestows unlimited powers on the current prime minister without any judicial oversight at all . this clearly leaves the door wide open to serious violations of fundamental human rights . '' martial law was imposed shortly before thailand 's military seized power last may , ousting the democratically-elected government of yingluck shinawatra after months of sometimes violent street protests . since then , the ncpo has curbed civil liberties , muzzled the media and rounded up opponents . amnesty international says that since may , hundreds of people have been arbitrarily held and dozens brought before military courts for engaging in peaceful political gatherings or expression . thai political scholar and coup opponent pavin chachavalpongpun told cnn that the move from martial law to the new security order amounted to `` pouring the same wine into a new bottle . '' `` the junta is trying to reinvent itself , but the substance is still there , '' he said . `` in a word : it 's absurd . everyone knows in thailand they had to abolish the martial law because of international pressure . `` but article 44 is a lot worse than the martial law because it gives total power to the ncpo . '' thailand 's military rulers have insisted that such restrictive measures are needed to maintain stability , following a decade of political conflict which has pitted a royalist , middle-class bangkok elite against shinawatra 's supporters , mostly drawn from the urban working class or the rural north . but pavin did not believe there was a sufficient threat to national security to justify the new order . `` the notion of national security has been exploited over and over , '' he said . a spokesperson for the u.s. embassy in bangkok said it was important that thai citizens were allowed `` to freely exercise their fundamental rights , including the rights of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly .

'' the deaths are the latest illustration of the increasing flow of migrants from north africa and the middle east through the mediterranean and into europe -- assuming they survive the trip . gemma parkin , a spokeswoman for save the children , said that the number of migrants who have fled to find refuge in europe has skyrocketed 70 % this year over last , a dramatic rise that she attributed mostly to the deteriorating security situation in libya . about 8 % of the recorded migrants between january and april 19 of this year are children , parkin said . of those , 70 % are n't unaccompanied by adults -- some of them as young as 9 years old . such numbers represent only people rescued at sea or caught once they reach land . frontex , the european union 's border management agency , says that many illegal immigrants get through without being detected ; moreover , most of them come in legally via airports and then overstay their visas . cnn 's nick paton walsh reported from tripoli and cnn 's steve almasy and greg botelho wrote in atlanta . cnn 's ingrid formanek in catania , italy , contributed to this report .",

'' yemen has been rocked by violence and political turmoil for months . houthi rebels -- minority shiites who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority sunni country -- forced yemeni president abdu rabu mansour hadi from power in january , placing him under house arrest and taking over sanaa , the country 's capital . hadi escaped in february , fled to the southern city of aden and said he remained president . he fled to saudi arabia last month as the rebels and their military allies advanced on aden . now the violence is intensifying as saudi arabia and other arab nations target the rebels in yemen with airstrikes . yemeni-americans are trapped in the conflict , but have n't gotten enough help from the u.s. government , the council on american-islamic relations told cnn sunday . zahra billoo , a spokeswoman for the advocacy group , said it 's helping al-labani 's family and the families of other yemeni-americans . `` all of these other governments , russia , china , ethiopia , india ... they have all been evacuating their citizens . so to say that it 's impossible for the u.s. to evacuate their citizens is difficult to grasp , '' billoo said . responding to the criticism , the u.s. state department told cnn that there are no current plans to evacuate private u.s. citizens from yemen . `` we encourage all u.s. citizens to shelter in a secure location until they are able to depart safely . u.s. citizens wishing to depart should do so via commercial transportation options when they are available , '' a spokesman for the state department told cnn in a statement . `` additionally , some foreign governments may arrange transportation for their nationals and may be willing to offer assistance to others .

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's easy to be anxious about the threat posed by the islamic state of iraq and syria . after all , this is a brutal organization that not only kills but seems to revel in doing so in ways designed to shock the world -- from the beheadings of journalists to burning a jordanian pilot alive . such moves are part of this murky group 's propaganda and its deliberate efforts to manipulate information . so what can and should we make of the organization ? i explore the issue in depth in a special airing sunday night . and although it 's important to start with the caveat that isis is indeed trying to scare and confuse us , i took away some tentative lessons from speaking with the people who have traveled inside the minds of isis . first , isis is clearly about religion -- its version of radical islam -- but it is also about power . there is increasing evidence that the military backbone of isis is made up not by a group of islamic zealots , but rather high-ranking officers from saddam hussein 's army -- baathists who were at least ostensibly secular . an internal isis report detailing its organizational structure was reported on last week in the german weekly der spiegel . that report describes a group that uses its religious ideology as a recruiting and governing philosophy , much like communism . but underneath it , much like communism , is simply a drive for control , a lust for power . next , isis presents itself as a global organization , but it has thrived because of a local cause . the group has gained territory , cash and recruits primarily because of the rage and rebellion of the sunnis of iraq and syria , who believe they must fight the shiites to secure their own survival and strength . the reality is that that sunni cause is going to endure for some time . the united states has been successful in its tactical battles against isis and has managed to push the group back from many of its gains in iraq . but the sunnis of the region will remain in rebellion and the sunni-dominated areas will remain in turmoil -- chaos that isis will be able to capitalize on this chaos . in the long run , isis might very well find that its greatest foes lie within its so-called caliphate . the few reports that are emerging from areas controlled by isis suggest that , unsurprisingly , people do not like living under a brutal , theocratic dictatorship . they live in fear , and even those who chose it as an alternative to shiite rule are growing disenchanted . in this respect , isis is like other radical islamic groups , such as the taliban -- they have an allure in the abstract , but once they are actually governing in their medieval , barbarous manner , the allure fades and the disenchantment builds . the result is ever-increasing repression . remember , no one has ever voted isis into power anywhere . the group simply slaughters its way to control . of course , one of the big questions has been : is isis a threat to the west ? the group 's leaders declare that it is . but their ambitions appear to be mostly centered on their arab enemies , on building a caliphate in iraq and syria . they understand , of course , that to be terror group no. 1 , they must battle the country that is the world 's no. 1 power -- the united states . with that in mind , they seek such a confrontation and hope that the united states will come to the middle east and fight them on their terms , on their terrain . still , while they are opportunists , and they ask and hope that their followers act in america , their main focus is not to come here -- they want americans to go there . yet no matter how one rates the level of the threat isis poses , the group has changed the nature of terror . the leaders of isis have recognized that above all , they are a messaging machine , which in turn becomes a recruitment machine . this means that the key is not what happens on the ground , but on the airwaves and in the bits and bytes of the internet . and isis does this better than anyone before them because while their gruesome videos would seem a repulsive turn-off -- and are to most -- they still work on the web . the shock and awe they produce makes them go viral , and thus are seen by tens of millions . that ensures that these videos attract those utterly alienated young men -- a few thousand among the world 's 1.6 billion muslims -- who seek revenge , glory and gore . unfortunately , as long as those young muslim men , scattered across the globe , are attracted to isis and stream to its cause , the group presents the world with a danger that is impossible to fully assess but is one that grows by the month .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- the justices of the supreme court practice politics as much as law -- and that will be clearer than ever when the issue of same-sex marriage comes before the court on tuesday . public opinion on same-sex marriage has turned upside down since the supreme judicial court in massachusetts first legalized the practice in 2003 . overwhelming opposition has turned into substantial majority support , especially among young people of all political persuasions . even the name of the issue has changed -- to marriage equality . of course , the constitution has not changed since 2003 , a point that will surely be made by such opponents of same-sex marriage as justice antonin scalia . to originalists like scalia -- those who believe the constitution should be interpreted only as it was originally understood by the framers -- the idea of a constitutional right to same-sex marriage is anathema . to them , the constitution means only what it meant to those who wrote it -- and james madison -lrb- or the authors of the 14th amendment , just after the civil war -rrb- never gave a thought to whether they were granting gay people the right to marry . but the supreme court has always been about a lot more than the intentions of the framers . and public opinion is just one of the extrajudicial factors that the justices sometimes take into consideration . in 1954 , the supreme court ruled unanimously that public schools could no longer segregate students by race , even though the authors of the 14th amendment clearly considered segregated schools to be permissible . chief justice earl warren , who wrote the opinion in brown v. board of education , recognized that the world had changed , especially in light of the cold war . warren knew that segregated schools damaged the united states ' reputation in the contest for hearts and minds around the world , and he steered the court accordingly . warren 's motives had nothing to do with the framers ' intentions , and little to do with the words of the constitution itself , but these kinds of motivations have been common throughout the history of the supreme court . there are risks , of course , when the justices are guided by more than the text and history of the constitution . like everyone else , the justices have imperfect instincts when it comes to measuring public attitudes . justice ruth bader ginsburg is a fervent supporter of abortion rights for women , but she has expressed reservations about the court 's decision in roe v. wade , the 1973 ruling that required all 50 states to legalize abortion . she has argued that the court interrupted a political process for legalization that was already underway , and that the case ignited a backlash that wound up hurting the cause of abortion rights . her position is debatable on several scores . abortion rights were not ascendant everywhere in the '70s , and opponents were already well mobilized . but ginsburg 's misgivings about roe have served as an important backdrop to the supreme court 's consideration of same-sex marriage . still , when it comes to supreme court decisions , it is usually safe to bet that a majority of the justices will come down on the side favored by most of the public . in any case , as we head into the argument , it looks like most of the justices have already made up their minds . after the court decided united states v. windsor in 2013 , which invalidated most of the 1996 law known as the defense of marriage act , more than a dozen federal district courts around the county said the reasoning of that case required the legalization of same-sex marriage . these judges allowed these marriages to begin taking place around the country . supporters of the existing laws went to the supreme court and asked for stays of the lower court rulings , because the justices themselves had not yet permitted the marriages to take place . but in each case , the supreme court denied the stays and allowed same-sex marriages to proceed -- those marriages are now legal in 37 states and the district of columbia . in a brief dissenting opinion from the failure to grant the stays , justice clarence thomas suggested the issue had already been settled in the minds of his colleagues . `` this acquiescence -lsb- in allowing marriages to proceed -rsb- may well be seen as a signal of the court 's intended resolution of that question , '' thomas wrote . `` this is not the proper way to discharge our ... responsibilities . '' but thomas only drew scalia to join his dissent , suggesting that even fellow conservatives chief justice john roberts and samuel alito saw the writing on the wall . in any case , at oral argument , we 'll get a clue what the justices are thinking about the issue . but we already know that their decision , like so many in the court 's history , will be based on a great deal more than the text of the constitution .",

'' his attorney at the time , david aylor , said that slager `` felt threatened and reached for his department-issued firearm and fired his weapon . '' but then came the video . we watched in horror as we saw slager shoot scott in the back multiple times . then we saw slager pick up something from one location and place it near scott 's lifeless body . on tuesday , the officer was arrested on murder charges . north charleston police chief eddie driggers told reporters , `` i have watched the video , and i was sickened by what i saw . '' apparently so was slager 's attorney , who announced after the video was made public that he was no longer representing the officer . after the video became public , the officials in north charleston deftly handled the situation . however , it was an easy case . there is no plausible evidence that slager feared for his life when scott is seen running away . in ferguson , the video we have in the death of michael brown is of press conferences with police chief tom jackson , who refused to release the police officer 's name , but did release a video that appeared to show michael brown stealing cigars . we have the video of the military weapons deployed by the police in ferguson that were trained on its residents and the press . the world seethed . north charleston 's police force is about 80 % white , with a population of 47 % black and 37 % white in the city . ferguson 's police force is 94 % white -lrb- only three of the 53 police officers are black -rrb- , and the city is 67 % black and 29 % white . both north charleston and ferguson have police forces that are not representative of the population they serve , yet because of a video north charleston 's police force got in front of the story . i 'm not sure north charleston gets here without learning something from the mistakes of ferguson . i have heard many commentators say the north charleston shooting does n't have anything to do with race . i do n't buy it . i wonder how many whites in north charleston with broken taillights get pulled over ? being pulled over for driving while black is a well-known phenomenon , which i discuss in my `` critical race theory '' casebook . racial profiling by slager could have been the catalyst for scott being pulled over in the first place . yes , the north charleston officials behaved differently than the officials in ferguson . i do n't think it 's because race had nothing to do with it . it is that perhaps the north charleston officials are better than those in ferguson when it comes to racially charged situations -- especially given the instructive fallout from brown 's shooting . and , of course , the video . it remains to be seen whether slager will be convicted of murder . strange things can happen in a jury room . recall how the rodney king videotape allowed a simi valley , california , jury to acquit the los angeles police officers , but a federal jury later convicted the officers of violating king 's civil rights . what a video proves can sometimes be in the eye of the beholder .",

'' it felt like no time had passed before we were told we had to go . the shelling had begun . we 'd been hearing pops of sniper fire all day but now we could hear rounds of automatic weapons and they were getting louder . as we arrived back at port , we found we were n't leaving alone . after waiting at port , praying a passing ship would dock , ours had become an unexpected lifeline for some of the families caught in the fighting . the harbor-master asked if we could take 60 refugees . it did n't feel like the answer could be anything but yes . what we did n't realize until it was too late was that the refugees were being charged $ 300 a person : an `` exit fee . '' those who did n't have the money were pushed back behind the wrought iron gates of the port . those that did shared our day-and-a-half trip home . as the shores of djibouti grew closer , you could see the uncertainty begin to take over . many of them had come from comfortable lives , before the war shattered them . they had left homes that once hummed with air conditioners and televisions . would the camps have tvs , they asked . no , they would n't , i said . what i did n't say was that they 'd be lucky to have electricity . but woven amid the uncertainty was the relief of escape . some of the refugees took over our ship 's galley -- the kitchen . they 'd found a former chef amongst their number who commandeered the store cupboard , sending out a pick and mix of heaped trays . we got tuna spaghetti and more turkish coffee than our cameraman byron could possibly drink . because we 'd brought refugees back with us , we were asked by the djibouti coast guard to dock in the country 's north , in obok , so they could be given the proper status while they wait to see what happens back home . the immigration officials were -- understandably -- a little bemused by our presence amongst a boatload of people fleeing yemen , but to their credit they decided the important thing was that these families were now safe . from there djibouti port was just a few hours away , hours that stretched into infinity for the families ringing my phone to check that their loved ones had made it into harbor . over the last few hours , people had shyly come up to ask if they could borrow our phone to tell their families they were safe . now a deluge of anxious parents , siblings and partners flooded my ear , asking how it could possibly be that we were n't yet on dry land . but eventually we were , and as we watched the djiboutian officials unload what remained of people 's belongings onto shore , it was a reminder that these were the lucky ones . thousands more are still waiting back in yemen , hoping they too will reach a safe port .",

'' asked a writer at the washington post . is n't violence at home what leads to violence outside the home ? is n't this why rioting happens ? i 'm not excusing violence in any form . i wish it did n't exist . but baltimore is n't on fire because of mothers like graham . in fact , what we need , not only in communities like baltimore but also in communities around the country , are more mothers like her . mothers who will do whatever it takes to protect their children and steer them through the increasingly tricky course of adolescence . i do n't see graham as an abusive mother spreading the gospel , or at least the inevitability , of violence . i do n't see her as a hero , either . what i do see in graham is a woman who is just like millions of other mothers of adolescents , mothers whose daily struggle is focused on guiding their kids in a positive direction while also helping them develop their own identities and independence . mothers who know the anger and frustration that can result when they catch their teenager in a lie . as graham told anderson cooper , she 'd told michael the night before not to join in any riots . he swore he would n't . but her momma bear sense kicked in , and when she heard that school was closing early , she did n't take the chance that he 'd stick to his promise . she went to the site of the riots to make sure that she could help him stay the course . she went there so that she could help him keep his promise . and when she got there and saw he had n't , as she suspected , she reacted in the way that she knew would , in that moment , be most effective to get him out of there . and that 's the key here . it 's easy to punish a teenager for acting out , just as it 's easy to punish graham for taking out her frustrations on michael in a physical way . but graham 's actions are evidence of her commitment as a parent . for better or worse , she knows her son . and she knows her community , and her reality . she knows that she 's the mother of an adolescent boy living in a city caught up in a very heated , violent moment . and she will do anything to protect her son , including put herself in a dangerous situation to pull him out of there . can we all say that ? toya graham raises an important point that 's often missing in the discussions of how to curb violence : moms have power . the world needs more momma bear types -- mothers who might be willing to put themselves between their child and certain danger . mothers who are willing to defy the `` expert '' advice telling them that teenagers need the room to make mistakes ; that hovering or even trying to anticipate their misbehavior only stunts their development and leads to more misbehavior . now more than ever , there are exceptions to that rule . those of us who live in communities that are generally safe ca n't imagine the level of fear and frustration that must run through the very core of a mother like graham . we do n't all face the same obstacles as the people who live in places like baltimore . but we all face the same challenges in raising children . perhaps it 's time to recognize that , at least in that sense , we 're more alike than we are different .",

    "article": "hong kong -lrb- cnn -rrb- four months after the end of the massive occupy protests that clogged hong kong 's streets in a bid for greater voting rights , another confrontation is heating up in the former british colony . the flashpoint ? a controversial beijing-backed election proposal tabled wednesday that pro-democracy legislators have already sworn to veto , describing it as `` ridiculous . '' in a speech before the city 's legislature , chief secretary carrie lam said that if approved , the proposal would give hong kongers the right to vote for their next leader in 2017 . the catch , of course , is candidates would have to be approved by a mostly pro-china committee . dissenting pro-democracy legislators wearing black marched from the chamber as soon as lam 's speech ended . some legislators raised yellow umbrellas , a symbol of the occupy movement . `` their fake universal suffrage is an insult to everybody 's intelligence ; that 's why we refused to stay in the chamber . '' hong kong democratic party chairwoman emily lau told cnn . lau said that she and other pro-democracy candidates would cast votes to ensure it does not become law . hong kong has become increasingly polarized over the last few years as the city fights over what kind of political system it should have as a special administrative region of china . according to the agreement signed by the united kingdom that returned the city to chinese control in 1997 , hong kong would receive 50 years of `` high autonomy '' under an arrangement called `` one country , two systems . '' part of that deal included establishing an election system based on the principles of universal suffrage . but nearly eighteen years after the handover , the city continues to fight over what universal suffrage really means . hong kong 's leaders argue its latest proposal fulfills the long-awaited promise of universal suffrage by giving each resident the right to cast a vote . all that 's left is for the legislature to approve the proposal , and then everyone can go home happy , they say . pro-democracy hong kongers beg to differ . `` if it is a genuine election , people should be free to stand and people should be free to vote , '' said lau . `` now all you have is a vote , and the candidates must be vetted by a committee consisting of business and political elites . it 's horrendous . `` to say the majority of hong kongers want to support this nonsensical package is a blatant lie . . if nothing is changed , we will definitely vote it down . '' to become law , the proposal must receive the support of two thirds of hong kong 's 70 legislators . but lau and 26 other pro-democracy legislators make up more than a third of the chamber , meaning they can veto the bill . if they do , then the city 's electoral reform process will effectively return to square one . hong kong 's leadership has warned pro-democracy legislators against the veto , saying the city might never again receive a chance for political reform . `` we must strive for consensus , '' lam told legislators . `` we sincerely hope the pan-democrats abandon their passive attitude . '' but consensus seems unlikely . hong kong and chinese leaders have repeatedly said there is no room for the proposal to change . in response , lau and other pro-democracy legislators will launch a citywide campaign this weekend to rally public opinion against the proposal . and she did not rule out the possibility of a repeat of last year 's massive street protests . `` should people decide to resort to civil disobedience again , its up to them , '' she said . `` whatever we do , our struggle must be peaceful , orderly , nonviolent . and we will do our best .

'' that phrase reminded me of my dad 's favorite saying , `` to err is human but to forgive is divine , '' which comes from a pope , but not a catholic holy man . but enough about that , i have to get back to reading .",

'' the webb telescope is a big probe . hubble is about the size of a school bus but jwst is as big as a tennis court . there is n't a rocket currently capable of carrying that so as chandler explained : `` it has to be folded up like a flower and then unfurled like a transformer . '' named after james e. webb , a former nasa leader , jwst is being designed to study the first stars and galaxies that formed in the early universe . nasa says that to see these objects the telescope will have to detect objects which are 10 to 100 times fainter than hubble can currently see . instead of studying visible and ultraviolet light like hubble , the jwst will work in the infra-red spectrum , allowing scientists to detect more distant targets . the new telescope requires a huge mirror of 25 square meters -lrb- about 270 square feet -rrb- -- and a golf ball of gold -lrb- about 48 grams or 1.7 ounces -rrb- to optimize it for infra-red light . it is then coated with glass . but technology like this does n't come cheap . according to nasa , the mission , which is in collaboration with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the canadian space agency -lrb- csa -rrb- and involves a total of 14 countries , will cost $ 8.5 billion . nasa says that the project has four main goals -- namely , to search for the first galaxies formed after the big bang , find out how galaxies evolved , observe the birth of stars and planets and investigate the potential for life on other planets . scientists hope the telescope will be able to tell us more about objects that formed 13 billion years ago -- about 700-800 million years after the big bang . but closer to home , scientists also believe the new telescope will able to detect planets around nearby stars . nasa says jwst should be able to operate for between five and 10 years , restricted only by the amount of fuel it has to maintain orbit and the ability of the electronics to stand up to the harsh space environment . opinion : why astronomy counts on earth .",

'' another man , from liberia , told me he had lived and worked in libya for 15 years , but was terrified at the prospect of isis gaining even more territory . an egyptian translator working for the italian police told me they had information that a large group of syrians were gathered in a tripoli warehouse , and were expected to make the journey to italy in the coming days . it seems that all the victims of the multiple tragedies and woes of africa and the middle east -- grinding poverty , war and the rise of isis -- are washing up on the shores of italy . the wars , unrest , upheaval , misery and injustice i 've covered over the last 20 years , in syria , in libya , in west africa and elsewhere , seem to be coming together to remind those who have enjoyed europe 's relative peace and prosperity that no man is an island . the small group of migrants in augusta has been taken in by the italian authorities . they 've been fed , clothed , received medical treatment , and will be taken to migrant camp in northern italy . most will then try move further north , to countries like france , belgium , the netherlands and the uk , where economic opportunities are better than in austerity-wracked italy . others will stay in italy , trying to eke out a living in the twilight economy as street vendors and beggars . and as they settle in , somehow or other , more and more will come to italy 's shores .",

'' it will use a form of cryptocurrency -- similar to bitcoin -- as its national currency , bypassing the need for a central bank and will , according to its constitution , keep government 's noses out of everything possible , from the banks to prostitution . `` liberland prides itself on personal and economic freedom of its people , which is guaranteed by the constitution , which significantly limits the power of politicians so they could not interfere too much in the freedoms of the liberland nation , '' the world 's newest constitutional document states . financial regulation will be minimal , if at all present . jedlicka says almost 300,000 applications for citizenship have been received , about 20 of which have been accepted . `` thousands of americans , swiss people . also a lot of arabic peoples who feel oppressed by the regimes there . '' he envisions , ultimately , a community of around 35,000 liberlanders , not all of whom will be full-time residents . he says he expects trouble from his neighbors , whose land he has effectively annexed . `` from serbia , croatia , we expect some trouble but we expect international laws will applied and any movement against us would be an attack on a sovereign nation , and we will offer nothing but passive resistance . for now , -lrb- though -rrb- we will make roads , docks . '' for its part , the serbian ministry of foreign affairs released a statement to cnn that stated that liberland would not theoretically impinge upon its border , which is delineated by the danube , but `` the ministry also considers this a frivolous act which needs no further comment .

'' the conservancy acquired the northern white rhinos -- two males and two females -- in 2009 from a zoo in the czech republic . suni , the other male northern white rhino at the conservancy , died last year . in another incident , another male , angalifu , died at the san diego zoo last year , bringing the subspecies closer to extinction . there are no known northern white rhinos left in the wild . a total of five remain in captivity worldwide : three in kenya , and one each at zoos in san diego and the czech republic . but sudan , a male , is in a company of one . 11 wildlife experiences that could vanish in your lifetime .",

'' amid all the pressure of playing professional golf , spieth 's 14-year-old sister provides him with perspective . `` how has she shaped my upbringing ? well , she 's the most special part of our family . she 's the funniest part of our family , '' he said . `` i love having her around . she 's an incredible sister , my biggest supporter . she is somebody who you can watch and then reflect on the big picture of life and understand that all these frustrations in a day , or in a round of golf , are really secondary . `` we would n't have that realization without her . '' at the age of just 14 , the prodigy from texas -- who was named after basketball legend michael jordan -- had been clear about what he wanted : his aim was to take the masters title one day . and he betrayed virtually no sign of nerves throughout his stunningly dominant performance , letting slip only a muttered `` oh dear '' when he marginally sliced a tee shot halfway through the final round . last year , spieth lost the lead just before the nine-hole turn on the last day -- but he never looked like being denied this time , beating phil mickelson 's masters record of 26 birdies for good measure . `` to sit with this jacket on and to be a part of the history of augusta national and the masters was something i watched slip away last year , '' said spieth , who described the reality of winning as `` even better '' than his dreams . `` i had a chip on my shoulder -lrb- about that -rrb- . i carried some momentum into this week and it all came together , right at the right time . '' shown a picture of himself wearing one of the most coveted pieces of clothing in sport , spieth , born in dallas , added : `` putting on the jacket , it looks good . it looks good . i 'm ok wearing green ! '' he could n't stop grinning as he said that he hoped to be finishing his final masters appearance in 50 years ' time , but added that he would `` still remember what it was like walking up the 18th hole today . '' and as he looked less far ahead , he revealed that he would be staying true to his roots at next year 's champions dinner . asked what he would put on the menu for that event , he said : `` it would be some form of texas bbq . '' the unassuming spieth 's success brings to mind other stars whose supreme ability and self-belief saw them become major champions in the early days of their careers . in 1985 , german tennis player boris becker stunned wimbledon when , at the age of 17 , he defeated kevin curren to become the event 's youngest ever men 's champion -- a record that still stands today . becker said people `` thought i had done something i was n't supposed to do , something that should n't have been possible . but i did it -- and then i did it again at 18 , just to make the point . '' american player michael chang was 118 days younger than becker when he won the french open in 1989 , while swiss star martina hingis was just 16 when she triumphed at the 1997 australian open . last year , at the age of only 15 , martin odegaard became norway 's youngest international footballer when he played in a friendly against the united arab emirates , provoking huge media interest and the attention of europe 's top clubs , before he signed for spanish giant real madrid . for them , as for spieth , perhaps success was meant to be from the earliest days . and as he looked at a picture of himself with a golf club in hand , taken at the age of 6 or 7 at his grandparents ' home in north carolina , he reflected on the determination that had put him in the green jacket , referring to another major winner . `` how about the focus on that swing ? '' he asked . `` that 's a little john daly-like there , is n't it ? ''",

'' no horse is snoozing now . the flights are over and they 're in las vegas to work . vegas is home to the finals for the sixth time since first hosting showjumping in 2000 . the venue is the thomas & mack center , a stone 's throw from the strip , which had the distinction of being opened by frank sinatra and diana ross in 1983 . organizers believe more than 80,000 fans will attend this week 's event , which boasts an $ 8 million budget . expect elvis presley beaming down from the jumbotron ; chefs from the bellagio serving vip guests who paid upwards of $ 1,500 a ticket ; and tennis legend steffi graf presenting the trophies . in the past , that was not your usual showjumping and dressage atmosphere -- but that 's something the sport is trying to change . hosting world-class horsesport in vegas is a way to raise its profile in the united states . as with this month 's showjumping on miami beach , the thinking is location , location , location . for the riders , few locations are comparable . `` it 's like a wrigley field feel , '' said tim keener , one of the vegas organizers , describing how the bowl of the arena will seat spectators unusually close to the action . showjumping comes here for the showbiz . in previous years , trophies have been handed out by flying showgirls descending from the rafters . elvis impersonators have burst into the arena on horseback . this year , a `` selfie booth '' will let fans crowd in with leading riders for awkward photos on their phones -- and there will be quite some choice of riders . since the world cup finals are among the most prestigious titles available , the cast list over the next four days features almost all of the world 's top names . in showjumping , germany 's daniel deusser is both the defending world cup champion and the new world no. 1 , unseating britain 's scott brash . the germans are the most successful nation at the world cup finals , with 10 showjumping victories , and three-time champion marcus ehning will also compete . the hosts have a superstar and 2013 champion in beezie madden , while 2012 champion rich fellers will ride aptly named `` comeback king '' flexible , a horse undeterred by a series of illnesses and injuries which would have seen almost any other stallion retire . in dressage , britain 's charlotte dujardin and valero are the runaway favorites to successfully defend last year 's world cup title . the partnership is the first ever to hold the world cup alongside olympic , world and european gold . few riders are expected to mount a serious challenge if dujardin and valegro perform well , but watch out for germany 's isabell werth and up-and-coming us rider laura graves . graves , 27 , has barely spent a year on the u.s. senior team , yet finished fifth in last year 's world equestrian games on board verdades . the action begins on thursday , april 16 , with dressage reaching a climax on the saturday and showjumping a day later . but if you miss it , the chances are you wo n't have to wait long for another chance . vegas is so in love with horses , organizers are already planning a bid to bring the event back in 2019 .",

'' he waves to the tunisian boat , where an older man in a jacket waves back . busonera gives him a thumbs up , and steers the ship to the right . it 's a routine evening for the calabrese , and that is just fine with the crew . they 've seen enough troubles in their time to appreciate an uneventful day 's work . back in the galley , i ask cortese about his worst experience while serving at sea with the guardia di finanza . he and most of his shipmates took part in the rescue effort on october 3 , 2013 , after a ship with hundreds of migrants had gone down off lampedusa . more than 350 people died in that disaster . the crew of the calabrese was able to rescue four of the survivors . cortese 's cheery demeanor suddenly becomes serious . `` i still remember pulling out of the water , with our hands , a young , pregnant woman who had just died , '' he recalls . `` there were children , '' adds his crewmate , idone , shaking his head . `` we recovered the bodies of children . it was a bad situation . i remember the body of a boy we recovered . we put him in a body bag . his head was in this hand , '' he said waving his hand as if he had just picked up the lifeless body . why migrants are risking their lives to reach italy . cortese and idone stress that as fathers , there is nothing worse than having to see the bodies of dead children . `` at the moment , '' recalls cortese , `` we were too busy to think about it , but when we go home , before going to sleep , it comes back to us . '' he emphasizes that he and his shipmates were just doing their duty as professional military men . out in the mediterranean , with no land in sight , you realize just how vast it is . and although it 's been warm on land in sicily recently , at night on the water , it 's cold and windy . on board the calabrese , we are warm , well-fed and in good company . the ship is well-maintained and equipped with state-of-the-art equipment , allowing busonera to plow confidently through the waves in the dark without fear of running into anything . it contrasts starkly with conditions migrants have recounted to us of the rickety boats and unseaworthy rubber dinghies they use to try to cross the mediterranean . often they 're without food , water or shelter , their boat 's crew inexperienced and untrained . that 's if they have a crew at all . many migrants have been beaten and robbed of all their possessions before they board . and unless a ship like the calabrese comes to their rescue , death at sea is a definite possibility .",

    "article": "baghdad , iraq -lrb- cnn -rrb- izzat ibrahim al-douri , a former top deputy to saddam hussein and more recently a key figure in sunni extremist groups battling the iraqi government , has been killed in a security operation in that country , iraqi state-run television reported friday . al-douri was the highest-ranking member of hussein 's regime to evade capture -- the `` king of clubs '' in a deck of playing cards used by american troops to identify the most-wanted regime officials . he also was a man thought to have led the post-hussein sunni extremist group naqshbandi army . military analysis website globalsecurity.org says the naqshbandi army supports isis , which has taken over parts of iraq and syria . al-douri was killed in an operation by iraqi security forces and shia militia members in the hamrin mountains between tikrit and kirkuk , iraq , shia militia commander hadi al-ameri said . that militia is a predominantly shiite fighting group that worked with iraqi troops earlier this month to liberate the iraqi city of tikrit from isis . the death of al-douri was also reported by the governor of salahuddin province , raid al-jubouri , who spoke by phone on iraqi television . al-douri 's body arrived friday in baghdad , where dna samples were taken to confirm the identity , said the spokesman of another shiite militia called hashd shaabi in an interview with state-run iraqiya tv . dna test results could be available in 48 hours , hashd shaabi spokesman yousuf al-kilabi told the outlet . the u.s. military is aware of the media reports but does n't have further information to evaluate them , said col. patrick ryder , spokesman for u.s. central command . while officials are aware of al-douri 's role in the hussein regime , ryder declined to comment about whether the united states or the coalition was targeting any specific individuals . al-douri was a military commander and vice chairman of the country 's revolutionary command council in hussein 's sunni-dominated regime -- effectively hussein 's no. 2 man . hussein 's regime fell during a u.s.-led invasion in 2003 . the u.s. military had said that after the iraqi leader 's fall , al-douri helped finance a sunni insurgency with money he transferred to syria before the government collapsed . a month before the invasion , al-douri presided over a military parade in mosul , an event covered by cnn , and his participation became one of the last times he was seen in public , covered by cnn . al-douri saluted troops from the reviewing stand as they marched by . then , just days before the u.s. invasion , al-douri addressed an emergency summit of the organization of the islamic conference to discuss ultimately unsuccessful ways to avert the war . al-douri accused the united states of aggression and blamed kuwait for his country 's suffering , calling leaders of the neighboring gulf state `` traitors '' for cooperating with the united states and israel . that comment prompted the kuwaiti representative to stand up and protest , to which al-douri countered , `` shut up , sit down you small agent -lsb- of the u.s. -rsb- , you monkey ! '' kuwaiti television cut away from the heated exchange and rejoined the conference later . al-douri 's efforts were all in vain . the united states invaded iraq on march 19 , 2003 , ousting hussein , al-douri and the entire regime . in subsequent years , several claims asserted that al-douri was either killed or captured during the war and its aftermath . at the same time , a man claiming to be al-douri released a number of audio messages over the years taunting iraqi and u.s. officials . in 2012 , a series of videos appeared online purporting to show al-douri deriding the shiite-led government that took over iraq after hussein 's ouster . cnn could n't independently verify the authenticity of those videos on youtube or the identity of the man speaking , though he bore a striking resemblance to al-douri . in the clips , the man who claimed to be al-douri wore an olive military uniform and sat behind a desk with an iraqi flag in the background . he derided iraq 's shiite-dominated government , led by then-prime minister nuri al-maliki , as well as what he described as meddling by neighboring iran . al-maliki 's dawa party , says al-douri , `` has announced iraq as the shiite capital . '' at that time , nine years had passed since the invasion and , al-douri claimed that iraq was still in peril . `` everyone can hear the sounds of danger echoing daily and threatening the country , '' he said . the videos were posted on what was the 65th anniversary of the arab socialist baath party , a political party founded in syria that later provided the political basis for hussein 's now outlawed baath party . cnn 's hamdi alkhshali reported from baghdad . cnn 's jason hanna wrote from atlanta and michael martinez from los angeles . cnn 's jamie crawford contributed from washington , d.c.",

'' `` the way america changed after 9/11 is the way kenya will change after garissa , '' ruto said in nyeri , according to a statement from his office . al-shabaab gunmen stormed garissa university college in eastern kenya this month , killing 147 people . kenya 's government says that attack was masterminded by senior al-shabaab leader mohamed mohamud , whose `` extensive terrorist network within kenya '' extends into the sprawling dadaab complex , according to a kenyan government document given to cnn . students wake to islamist militants ' terror . ruto , who is the second highest-ranking person in kenya 's government behind president uhuru kenyatta , said his government has had discussions with united nations officials about what to do with the camp . on saturday , a u.n. high commissioner for refugees officer said the agency had not received any formal request from kenya 's government about moving dadaab . the u.n. refugee agency manages the dadaab complex , having set up the first camps there in late 1991 amid somalia 's civil war . the agency and the governments of both kenya and somalia agreed in 2013 on a process for the repatriation of somali refugees . but that was supposed to be mutually agreed-upon and voluntary , in accordance with the refugees ' `` freely expressed wish and their relevant knowledge of the conditions '' where they 'd end up , according to the pact . none of those things , it seems , applies now to the move pushed by ruto on saturday . it 's not clear where he expects the refugees to go , other than somewhere into somalia and out of kenya . any mass move would be a monumental task , disrupting the already difficult lives of more than 600,000 somalis who call the camp their home . simply meeting basic needs is a challenge in the vast complex , which has seen devastating droughts , contagious diseases and other travails that have tested its residents and those trying to help . still , as tough as conditions there are , they are seen as a better alternative to life back in somalia , where al-shabaab is based and has carried out violent attacks for years . yet the islamist extremist group has n't confined its terror to its homeland , as illustrated by the garissa attack and the 2013 siege of nairobi 's upscale westgate mall , which ended with at least 67 dead . the dadaab complex came under government scrutiny after the westgate mall attack , too . but just a few weeks later , cnn 's nima elbagir managed to go from somalia to the dadaab refugee camp undetected by taking one of the panya , or `` rat routes , '' just like many others have done , al-shabaab sympathizers among them . such illicit travel along porous borders as well as police officers ' willful ignorance of migrants ' fake ids , as acknowledged by then-interior minister ole lemku , illustrates kenya 's challenge in keeping out threats from somalia . that 's why , in addition to moving the dadaab camp , kenya is building of a 435-mile -lrb- 700-kilometer -rrb- wall covering most of the somali border from mandera to kiunga -- a wall that ruto says has begun to prevent al-shabaab elements from getting into kenya . the deputy president also vowed that any businesses collaborating with the militant group will be shut down . these measures are in addition to kenyan airstrikes on al-shabaab camps in somalia in the days after the garissa massacre . `` we must secure this country at whatever cost , even if we lose business with somalia , '' ruto said saturday . `` no politics , no games , no half-measures should apply , as the death of the 147 students must touch all kenyans .

'' `` the tin drum , '' which was published in 1959 , `` breaks the bounds of realism by having as its protagonist and narrator an infernal intelligence in the body of a three-year-old , a monster who overpowers the fellow human beings he approaches with the help of a toy drum , '' the nobel committee wrote . the committee praised grass ' mastery of the german language and his ability to artfully exploit its possibilities of creating seemingly endless yet graceful sentences . grass was an icon in contemporary german culture with an unchanging iconic look -- his broad mustache , his eyes gazing over the top of his glasses , a tobacco pipe a constant companion in hand . in his later years , he became known for his continuing critique of human history in the 20th century -- and of current events . as recently as march , grass criticized the anti-islam movement pegida , patriotic europeans against the islamization of the west . he used the opportunity fire a jab at government that he said was corrupted by money interests . `` it 's not islam that threatens the federal republic -lrb- of germany -rrb- , '' he said in an interview with rp-online . de , `` but political lobbying . democracy has decayed into fake democracy . '' grass has also suggested that germans should be forced to invite refugees from crisis regions to live in their homes as a way of offering more shelter to the world 's destitute .",

'' in other words , now you do n't even have to be a good shot to hit the mark . the system has been developed by darpa 's extreme accuracy tasked ordnance program , known as exacto . `` true to darpa 's mission , exacto has demonstrated what was once thought impossible : the continuous guidance of a small-caliber bullet to target , '' said jerome dunn , darpa program manager . `` this live-fire demonstration from a standard rifle showed that exacto is able to hit moving and evading targets with extreme accuracy at sniper ranges unachievable with traditional rounds . fitting exacto 's guidance capabilities into a small .50 - caliber size is a major breakthrough and opens the door to what could be possible in future guided projectiles across all calibers , '' dunn said . videos supplied by darpa show the bullets making sharp turns in midair as they pursue their targets . it all conjures up images of a cartoon character frantically fleeing a bullet that follows him wherever he goes . only , these bullets are traveling at hundreds of miles per hour . and even the road runner ca n't run that fast . darpa says the smart bullets will also help shooters who are trying , for example , to hit targets in high winds . the goals of the exacto program are giving shooters accuracy at greater distances , engaging targets sooner and enhancing the safety of american troops , darpa said .",

'' sanctions and russia 's deep economic crisis , which saw the value of the russian currency , the ruble , plunge in value by 50 % against the dollar , is set to be a major a theme . so too is foreign policy . with moscow at odds with the west over ukraine , some of the released questions show how concerned ordinary russians are about their country 's place in the world . one unidentified schoolgirl asks : `` is there a threat to russia 's interests from the united states and europe ? and will there be a new iron curtain ? '' it 's not just russian schoolchildren who want to hear putin 's answer . critics of the kremlin , of course , slam this entire event as russia 's imitation of democracy in action . it 's hard to imagine a truly critical question , they say , getting aired on national television here . in fact , its best not to look at this event as an opportunity for russians to question their leader at all . instead , it is more like a highly produced , highly choreographed chance for their leader to speak to them , and to the world . sometimes , the kremlin likes to throw in a nasty surprise , too . last year saw nsa whistleblower , edward snowden , granted asylum in russia , address putin by videolink . who knows who may pop up this time .",

'' cuba and the united states had endured a half-century of enmity , the tension worsened by the two nations being only 90 miles apart . key events of those years include some of the most traumatic in modern u.s. history , such as the cuban missile crisis , the bay of pigs and the mariel boatlift of 1980 . but the two leaders have been building up to the historic face-to-face . obama spoke by phone wednesday with the cuban leader before heading to panama . they met friday at the dinner and are expected to spend a lot more time together on saturday when the summit begins in earnest . obama arrived in panama late thursday for the conference , which in years past was tinged with animosity at cuba 's exclusion . moments after marine one , obama 's helicopter , touched down in panama city , castro 's plane landed on the same tarmac . panamanian television carried both arrivals live . during their phone call wednesday , obama and castro discussed the ongoing process of normalizing relations between the united states and cuba , according to deputy national security adviser ben rhodes . he said it `` made sense '' for the two leaders to communicate before their anticipated interactions friday and saturday . those run-ins will represent the highest-level talks between the united states and cuba since a meeting between then-vice president richard nixon and then-prime minister fidel castro in 1959 . `` we 're in new territory here , '' rhodes said on friday . `` the reason we 're here is that the president strongly believes that an approach that was focused totally on isolation , focused totally on seeking to cut off the cuban people from the united states of america had failed . '' obama was expecting a warm welcome from the dozens of countries represented at the conference , after announcing in december he was seeking to engage havana in talks over reopening embassies and removing barriers to commerce and travel . in panama , obama is expected to announce he 's removing cuba from the united states ' list of countries that sponsor terrorism , a major advance in building diplomatic ties between the two countries . the state department delivered its report on the designation to the white house on wednesday ; obama said on thursday a panel of experts was reviewing it before he makes a final determination . the white house is n't ruling out a final decision before obama leaves panama late saturday night . in remarks during a brief stopover in jamaica on thursday , obama strongly hinted he was ready to remove cuba from the list , which also includes iran , sudan and syria . `` throughout this process , our emphasis has been on the facts , '' obama said . `` so we want to make sure that given that this is a powerful tool to isolate those countries that genuinely do support terrorism , that when we make those designations we 've got strong evidence that , in fact , that 's the case . '' `` as circumstances change , then that list will change as well , '' he said . while some inside cuba have expressed dissatisfaction at the pace of the diplomatic thaw , u.s. officials say they 're pleased at the progress toward re-establishing diplomatic ties , which the white house argues has helped improve relations with other countries in the region . obama said in jamaica he `` never foresaw that immediately overnight everything would transform itself . '' the overtures to cuba have not been universally popular in the united states ; some lawmakers were irate that obama was seeking to engage what they regard as a corrupt government . even as obama landed in panama the long-standing tensions between pro- and anti-castro activists was on full display . dissidents opposed to castro 's regime were violently accosted earlier this week by supporters of the cuban government . rhodes said the white house had `` expressed serious concerns '' about the violence and would continue to speak in support of human rights reforms on the island .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- the solar impulse 2 , the experimental plane attempting to fly around the world without using a drop of fuel , has been grounded by the weather in china . what was supposed to be an overnight pit stop in the southwestern city of chongqing has now stretched into a two-and-a-half week stay . it 's an unexpected layover that is testing the patience of the pilots and more than 60 team members , just a quarter of the way along a journey that will cover some 35,000 kilometers -lrb- 21,748 miles -rrb- over five months . `` you can believe that your will can influence the weather , '' says pilot bertrand piccard , who comes from a long family line of explorers . but `` then you 'll be really disappointed because it does n't work . `` or you just know that it 's an adventure you do with the forces of nature . '' piccard , along with andre borschberg , a swiss engineer , are taking turns flying the single-seater aircraft , which took off from abu dhabi on march 9 and has successfully flown through oman , india , and myanmar . there is much at stake . their mission , which the pilots say is aimed at proving the power of renewable energy , and inspiring innovation , has been 12 years in the making . in many ways , it has become piccard and borschberg 's raison d'etre . but so far , the solar impulse 2 has been spending a lot of time on the ground . the latest setback came when a thursday takeoff was canceled , because the cross winds in nanjing , the plane 's destination , were forecast to be too strong around its expected landing time . because of its weight , at just 2,300 kilograms -- about the same as a large suv -- the aircraft needs near perfect weather conditions , including cross winds of less than 4 knots , or about 7 kilometers an hour , in order to fly . while the team is used to waiting , they are clearly eager to move on . `` our boss is the sun , '' says solar impulse spokeswoman claudia durgnat . durgnat says there may be a tiny window ahead , with the next possible departure from chongqing on tuesday . `` it 's not good before , and the days after do n't look very clear . '' even with the delay , durgnat says , the plane technically is n't behind schedule . that 's because the team needs to wait until the end of the month for the northern hemisphere days to get longer , before the plane can venture across the pacific ocean to hawaii . with more than 17,000 solar cells along the tops of its wings and fuselage , the solar impulse 2 stores up energy during the day , in order to power the motors that carry it through the night , typically at speeds no faster than a car on a highway . inside a specially constructed tent at the end of the runway at chongqing international airport , a skeleton team of less than a dozen people works to complete the day 's tasks . the rest of the crew has been waiting for weeks in nanjing . even with the extended stay , no time is wasted . piccard spends a few hours of the afternoon in the cockpit , training to prepare for the solar impulse 's crossings over the pacific and atlantic ocean , what the team calls `` the moment of truth . '' the plane will then return to abu dhabi , where it had taken off . nearby , two technicians repair a couple of the flight computers , which display critical information in the cockpit , punching extra holes in their casings so they do n't overheat . meanwhile , borschberg has returned to switzerland to rest and get medical treatment for a migraine and a skin condition . the team expects him back in china early next week . borschberg is still scheduled to fly first leg of the pacific crossing , which could last up to five days and nights . `` the airplane is ready . the mission control center is ready . we 've been waiting for that moment since so long , '' says piccard . borschberg and piccard , who piloted an earlier version of the plane across the u.s. in 2013 , are no strangers to adventure . borschberg is a former fighter pilot , and piccard was part of the first team to circumnavigate the earth nonstop in a balloon in 1999 .",

'' `` i ca n't hide my happiness for the women but being released on bail is not the end of their ordeal , '' echoed li 's lawyer yan xin on chinese social media . `` without closing their cases , they still ca n't live without shackles -- we 'll have our work cut out for us . '' police had recommended last week that prosecutors press charges of `` assembling a crowd to disturb public order , '' which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison . the women are still considered suspects in an ongoing criminal investigation and may face charges in the future , wu 's lawyer liang xiaojun told cnn . they will be under surveillance for a year with their movements and activities restricted , and police can summon them for questioning at any time , liang added . `` this should n't be a moment of celebration , '' he said . `` the arbitrary detention and release of these women really shows the backwardness of china 's legal system . '' under china 's household registration system , only li is considered a beijing resident . police sent the other four back to their hometowns , disrupting their work and lives , according to the women 's lawyers . many have called the five members of women 's rights action group trailblazers . staging their protests through performance art or flash mobs , they highlighted feminist causes ranging from fighting domestic violence , gender equality at work , to more female public bathrooms -- drawing nationwide attention and even state media praise . their detention had drawn widespread condemnation , including from the united states . `` each and every one of us has the right to speak out against sexual harassment and the many other injustices that millions of women and girls suffer around the world , '' said john kerry , the u.s. secretary of state , in a statement friday . `` we strongly support the efforts of these activists to make progress on these challenging issues , and we believe that chinese authorities should also support them , not silence them . '' kerry 's predecessor hillary clinton -- a longtime champion of women 's rights who just announced her bid for the u.s. presidency -- called the jailing of the feminists `` inexcusable '' on twitter , joining the `` free the five '' hashtag campaign . china had rejected all international criticisms , insisting it 's a country ruled by law and that its judicial sovereignty be respected . supporters of the woman activists , however , sense the chilling effect of their ordeal on china 's nascent civil society , as the ruling communist party under president xi jinping continues to tighten its grip over the country . `` of course people will feel more afraid , '' said wei 's lawyer wang qiushi . `` women 's rights is among the most politically correct issues in china -- now even those who took up that cause ended up in jail .

'' bollinger also commented on the case in a 2014 new york magazine profile of sulkowicz , now a senior at columbia . `` this is a person who is one of my students , and i care about all of my students . and when one of them feels that she has been a victim of mistreatment , i am affected by that . this is all very painful . '' the defendants `` had the power , as well as the legal and contractual obligation '' to protect nungesser , who is also a senior , the lawsuit claims . `` by refusing to protect paul nungesser , columbia university first became a silent bystander and then turned into an active supporter of a fellow student 's harassment campaign by institutionalizing it and heralding it . '' columbia university declined to comment on the lawsuit . the school also declined to confirm the outcome of nungesser 's disciplinary proceedings . `` as we have said consistently , we do not and have not commented on individual students or disciplinary cases not only because of federal student privacy law , but also because of our ethical responsibility to ensure all current and future students have confidence that the university will never publicly discuss private matters they share when interacting with counselors and support staff , the campus disciplinary process or other resources we provide to them , '' spokesman robert hornsby said in statement . kessler also declined to comment on the lawsuit . the case has produced dueling narratives from both sides in national media outlets . the most recent came from nungesser in a daily beast article titled , `` columbia student : i did n't rape her , '' in which he shared a long exchange of facebook messages to support his claim that their sex was consensual . some of those exchanges were included in the lawsuit , but sulkowicz told cnn they were taken out of context in the suit . she also balked at the idea that nungesser would sue the school or her professor `` for allowing me to make an art piece . '' `` it 's ridiculous that he would read it as a ` bullying strategy , ' especially given his continued public attempts to smear my reputation , when really it 's just an artistic expression of the personal trauma i 've experienced at columbia , '' sulkowicz wrote in an email . `` if artists are not allowed to make art that reflects on our experiences , then how are we to heal ?

'' darpa says the so-called drone ships will be 132 feet long and likely cost about $ 20 million , significantly less than the billion-dollar manned warships currently in use . the development of the actuv aligns with the `` culture change '' described by navy secretary ray mabus tuesday at the navy league 's sea air space symposium at national harbor , maryland . `` unmanned systems , particularly autonomous ones , have to be the new normal in ever-increasing areas , '' maybus said . maybus said new staff will be put into place to help streamline , coordinate and champion unmanned systems in `` all domains .

'' santana told cooper an officer told him to wait where he was but eventually he left the scene to go to work . in other interviews , santana has said he feared for his life , which almost kept him from revealing the recording . santana recalled the moments when he recorded a roughly three-minute video of north charleston police officer michael slager shooting walter scott as scott was running away saturday . that evidence led to the officer 's firing and arrest on a murder charge . santana said when he first came on the scene while walking to his job he saw slager on top of scott , who was on the ground . he could hear the sound of a taser in use . at no time did santana see scott go after the taser . he believes scott was trying to get away . `` mr. scott never tried to fight , '' santana told cnn . police said slager used a taser against scott , but slager would also later tell a dispatcher that scott at some point had grabbed the taser . after slager shot scott five times , the officer went back to pick up something . santana thinks it was the taser but said he was n't 100 % sure what it was . neither the struggle nor the use of a taser was captured on video , because santana had yet to begin recording . what we know about officer slager . the cell phone video , which santana revealed this week , reignited national outcries surrounding police treatment of african-americans and led to a murder charge against slager , who is white . scott was black . police said slager pulled the 50-year-old scott over for a nonworking brake light on saturday morning . scott , according to a dash cam video , fled from slager for unexplained reasons , and the officer chased him on foot . when santana 's video begins , scott starts running away from the officer , with scott 's back to slager . the video shows slager shooting at scott eight times before scott falls down . who was walter scott ? scott 's mother , judy scott , told cooper this week that she would want to thank santana for coming forward . `` he was there . god planned that . he 's the ram in the bush -- i truly believe that , '' judy scott said . santana agreed . `` i think she was right , '' he said . `` god put me there for a reason . '' judy scott said she could n't watch the whole recording . `` when i saw my son running and i saw the policeman behind him , i could n't take it , '' she said . `` i had to turn away . i could n't handle it . in an interview with nbc 's matt lauer , santana suggested that he was giving media interviews in part to protect himself against retribution . `` at some point i thought about staying anonymous , and do n't show my face , do n't talk about it . but ... if i would n't show my face , everybody over there knows , including the police , who i am , '' santana said . santana did not say whether he had received threats . his attorney , todd rutherford , said santana 's video would be useful in an investigation -- not only into the shooting but also into whether scott received prompt medical attention . in the last half of the video , a second officer appears to examine scott with gloved hands . witness video , official accounts raise questions . santana said after he stopped recording , he watched for a few more minutes but never saw anyone perform cpr . a police report says a third officer -- not shown in the video -- reported seeing an officer administering first aid , and that the third officer approached and helped that person `` with first aid and cpr . '' on wednesday , asked whether cpr was performed on scott , north charleston police chief eddie driggers said : `` in the end of it -lrb- the video -rrb- , what i saw was -lrb- what i -rrb- believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of life-saving -lrb- procedure -rrb- , but i 'm not sure what took place there .

'' yost did not respond to a request for comment . dent , a veteran ford automotive worker , was arrested after the january traffic stop on charges of drug possession , assaulting an officer and resisting arrest . with the court decision wednesday , all charges from the arrest have been dropped . melendez pleaded not guilty to the new charges brought against him in an arraignment tuesday at inkster district court , according to his lawyer , david lee . `` we intend to vigorously contest the charges , '' lee said . `` i can understand how people might be disturbed by looking at -lsb- the video -rsb- ; however ; i hope everyone will withhold judgment until all the facts come out where they should in a court of law . '' worthy 's announcement came after the conclusion of two investigations into the incident by michigan state police and the wayne county prosecutor 's office . in the police report written after the january arrest , melendez wrote that he hit dent only after dent had threatened him and bit him in the arm . melendez wrote that as he approached the car , dent kept his hands from view , looked at him `` with a blank stare as if on a form of narcotic , '' and said , `` i 'll kill you . '' dent told cnn at the time that he had never threatened nor bit the police officer . `` i did n't bite anyone . i did n't have time to bite anyone . he was too busy pounding me in my head , '' dent said . rohl also alleged that the cocaine found at the scene had been planted by melendez . `` my client 's fingerprints will not be on that bag , '' rohl told wdiv .",

'' police estimated that 275,000 demonstrators marched in sao paulo . a sea of protesters dressed in the green and yellow of the brazilian flag used decades-old rallying cries to fire up their ranks , singing rock songs that date back to protests of the country 's one-time military dictatorship . it 's the second day of nationwide anti-government demonstrations in less than a month . and protesters vowed that it would n't be the last . there are a number of issues at play . one of the biggest : an investigation into a multimillion-dollar kickback scheme at the state-run oil company petrobras . most of the politicians accused in the investigation belong to rousseff 's workers party and its allies . and during many of the years that the alleged corruption took place , rousseff was the chairwoman of petrobras . there has n't been any evidence she was involved with the scheme , and her supporters say the position is merely a figurehead . rousseff has defended brazilians ' right to protest and acknowledged the need to clean up corruption at petrobras but denied any prior knowledge of the alleged kickback scheme . brazilians are still outraged . rousseff won re-election with just over 50 % of the votes in october , but her approval rating plummeted to 13 % after protests began last month . `` many things have changed since the election , '' janaina , a protester in sao paulo , said on sunday , noting that even some people who voted for rousseff were in the crowd . some protesters said they 'd rather see rousseff step down than push for impeachment , which could be difficult to push through without evidence tying the president directly to the corruption scandal . but janaina said impeachment remained a realistic option . `` yes , it has to be , '' she said . `` it 's our last hope .

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- in 2001 , the taliban wiped out 1700 years of history in a matter of seconds , by blowing up ancient buddha statues in central afghanistan with dynamite . they proceeded to do so after an attempt at bringing down the 175-foot tall sculptures with anti-aircraft artillery had failed . sadly , the event was just the first in a series of atrocities that have robbed the world of some of its most prized cultural heritage . but historical architecture is also under threat from calamities which might well escape our control , such as earthquakes and climate change . the thought of losing a piece of our collective history is a bleak one . but if loss ca n't be avoided , technology can lend a hand . now cyark , a non-profit company founded by an iraqi-born engineer , is using groundbreaking laser scanning to ensure that -- at the very least -- incredibly accurate digital versions of the world 's treasures will stay with us forever . ben kacyra was born in mosul , iraq , in 1940 . he moved to the united states in 1964 , and in the 1990s he was instrumental in the design of the first portable laser scanner . he founded cyark , a company that specializes in digital preservation of threatened ancient and historical architecture , in 2003 . `` two events happened that really influenced me and my wife , '' he told cnn 's nick glass , `` the taliban blew up the buddhas and an earthquake happened in bam , in iran . `` it demolished a whole mud city . so we looked at each other and we said , you know , sometimes you ca n't prevent an earthquake , obviously , and it 's very expensive to go back and rebuild , but if it had been scanned , our children and grandchildren would get the opportunity to come back and learn the history of that place . '' since then , kacyra has been doing exactly that : in a 2011 ted talk he explained his quest to preserve our `` collective treasure '' , and he has a plan to scan 500 world heritage sites in five years . so far , the list of completed scans includes ancient thebes , chichen itza , fort laramie , mesa verde , mount rushmore , petra , pompeii , rapa nui , the sydney opera house , tikal , and his native mosul . the idea is not just to protect endangered structures , but to offer free educational access to the digital recreations of important monuments via the web . `` we have that data , and if something -- god forbid -- happens to these , the data is there , '' says kacyra . in fact , current events have already caught up with the project : the royal tombs of kasubi , in uganda , were destroyed in 2010 by suspected arson . cyark had mapped them a year earlier , and that could lead to the reconstruction of what was lost . `` i 'm constantly looking at what 's happening in iraq and syria . `` i 'm so glad that we had already started and developed the tools that allowed us to go and be proactive to capture some of these things before these very unfortunate events . '' to scan the surroundings , cyark uses a portable , eye-safe laser device based on a technology called lidar -- a portmanteau of the words light and radar . it accurately maps a physical area much like a radar , but using lasers instead of radio waves . `` we have a very powerful laser that sends a beam of light pulsing 50,000 times per second , '' explains kacyra , `` which means that it 's collecting 50,000 points of everything that 's in front it as it pulses up and down and in a circular fashion , generating the geometry of everything that 's in the space around it . '' in other words , `` we gave the world a 3d laser scanner that has revolutionized how reality is captured . '' although its focus is in providing open access to cultural heritage , cyark is also attracting interest for alternative uses of the technology . `` we are discovering applications way beyond what we had anticipated , '' says kacyra . `` for example , the highway patrol wants to use it in accident reconstruction on the road or in crime scene investigations . where did the bullets go , trajectories and all that - this gives you the entire thing in minutes and then you can do all the analysis work . '' not even hollywood is immune from the allure of laser scanning . `` imagine it going all the way to art , the movies , movie sets . my wife got really excited about the first use in the movie field . '' before founding cyark , kacyra had developed a similar technology called cyrax , which he then subsequently sold . this technology was first used during the production of the 1997 sci-fi cult movie starship troopers , to scan an underground cave . `` they found out it was going to cost too much money to measure the cave so they could model it , something like half a million dollars and six weeks . `` they had heard about our scanning system so we went there . i think we did it for 20,000 dollars , and in a day or two , and it got used in a movie for the first time . `` it 's ubiquitous now in the movie industry for virtual sets .

'' but ever since , the trail went largely cold . until now . on tuesday , a franklin county grand jury indicted `` nine members of a criminal syndicate that collaborated to promote or engage in the theft ... and illegal trafficking '' of liquor from two different kentucky distilleries : frankfort 's buffalo trace -- makers of pappy -- and the nearby wild turkey distillery , makers of the eponymous bourbon , according to the indictment . just like making good bourbon -- a specific type of whiskey synonymous with the bluegrass state -- melton 's case required time to develop and old-fashioned kentucky ingenuity . the sheriff 's hunch was reflected in the indictment : of the nine named , two worked at buffalo trace and one worked at wild turkey . the alleged ringleader , according to assistant commonwealth attorney zach becker , is gilbert `` toby '' curtsinger , a 45-year-old loading dock worker at the buffalo trace distillery . curtsinger and his wife , julie , each face eight charges for allegedly engaging in organized crime . curtsinger -- who has worked at buffalo trace for more than 20 years -- was arrested in march after authorities , acting on a tip , found five barrels of bourbon behind a shed on his property , according to cnn affiliate wkyt . those barrels , weighing more than 500 pounds each and worth up to $ 6,000 apiece , had recently been stolen from wild turkey , melton told bourbonblog.com 's tom fischer . while an additional search warrant allegedly turned up illegal steroids from curtsinger 's home , there was no sign of any pappy . `` he does n't know anything about -lrb- stolen pappy van winkle -rrb- , '' his mother , teresa curtsinger , told cnn last month . in fact , she said , once he bonded out of jail , curtsinger returned to his job at buffalo trace . however , according to melton , `` curtsinger was involved in numerous thefts of pappy van winkle , as well as eagle rare bourbon , both in bottles and barrels .

'' quoting mohammed , the narrator says that those who `` perform prayer and pay alms '' will have `` their blood and property '' protected by the prophet unless islam dictates otherwise . `` you pay -lrb- tax -rrb- with willing submission , feeling yourselves subdued . our battle is a battle between faith and blasphemy , between truth and falsehood , until there is no more polytheism -- and obedience becomes allah 's on its entirety , '' the narrator says . earlier in the video , a different speaker says christians in the northern iraqi city of mosul were given the choice to embrace islam or maintain their christian faith and pay a tax . `` the islamic state has offered the christian community this many times and set a deadline for this , but the christians never cooperated , '' the speaker says . at the beginning of the video , a man who appears to be a judge in a court enforcing islam 's sharia law holds up documents and says a syrian christian had owed a syrian muslim 550,000 syrian pounds -lrb- about $ 2,900 -rrb- since 2004 , but the muslim was unable to obtain the money under president bashar al-assad 's regime . `` after applying to the islamic court he got his money back within one month , '' the man says . the law cited throughout the video comes from the quran 's surah 9:29 , whose exact translation is an area of dispute among religious scholars . the gist is that muslims are commanded to fight those who do n't believe in allah or the last day -lrb- islam 's equivalent of judgment day -rrb- unless the nonbelievers pay a tax or tribute . in february , isis released a video of 21 coptic christians from egypt being executed on a libyan beach . those captives , too , wore orange jumpsuits . in that video , released by al-hayat media center , another isis media arm , a masked man references the killing of osama bin laden and his burial at sea . `` the sea you have hidden sheikh osama bin laden 's body in , we swear to allah , we will mix it with your blood , '' he threatens in english . cnn 's anas hamdan , christine theodorou and brian walker contributed to this report .",

    "article": "cairo -lrb- cnn -rrb- mohamed morsy went from prison to the presidency . and now he 's going back to prison . the ousted president was convicted on charges of violence and inciting violence and sentenced to 20 years in prison for the torture of protesters outside the presidential palace in december 2012 . but he was acquitted of murder in the deaths of protesters . he stood trial with 14 co-defendants , including some of his presidential staff . all 14 co-defendants were also convicted of violence and inciting violence , and all were also acquitted of murder . morsy , who became egypt 's first democratically elected president in june 2012 , was deposed by a popularly backed military coup in july 2013 . after the sentencing , his freedom and justice party called the trial a `` travesty of justice . '' `` this is a sad and terrible day in egyptian history , '' the party said in a statement tuesday . `` coup leaders have sentenced mohamed morsi to decades in prison for nothing more than championing the democratic will of the people . '' but ramy ghanem , a civil plaintiff lawyer representing one of the torture victims , said the conviction was fair . `` this is a very appropriate and clear verdict on people that committed the crime , '' he said . `` this , in fact , was the maximum sentence for the charges . the surprise was the acquittal . '' hoda nasrallah , a lawyer representing two torture victims , called the outcome of the case typical for egypt . `` all the cases involving big gatherings and demonstrations in which protesters were killed usually see the culprits walk free . this case is a manifestation of this , '' she said . `` the public will always see the verdicts as politicized because there is no regime put on trial before falling , so everyone sees it as settling scores . it 's not about morsy only , but it also applies to -lrb- former egyptian president hosni -rrb- mubarak and others . this is the status quo in egypt . we wish we could see the trial of a regime when it is in power , not after that . '' nasrallah called for a `` fair trial , '' criticizing the fact that seven men killed during the december 2012 clashes were not included in this case , because they were affiliated with the muslim brotherhood , and that the involvement of other sides , including police , was n't investigated . morsy can appeal his conviction . but muslim brotherhood spokesman mohamed montasser has already issued an ominous warning on twitter : . `` sentencing the president wo n't pass , '' he said . `` the revolution will be ignited , popular anger will increase and we promise you unexpected revolutionary surprises . '' at various points in the trial , morsy said that he was still the president of egypt and refused to recognize the court as legal . attorney mohamed selim el-awa cited constitutional articles to the court that stipulated the steps for removing a president and putting him on trial -- something that required the approval of two-thirds of the parliament and a special court made of the country 's top judges . a judge on tuesday rejected the argument presented by el-awa and court-appointed lawyer el-sayed hamed that the court had no jurisdiction . hamed was appointed by the court after morsy 's defense team withdrew . he told cnn he met with morsy about three times over the past 16 months . he praised the `` neutrality of the court , '' rebuffing accusations of politicization . `` before the case reached the court , it was dominated by politics more than the law , and i said this in my argument at the court . but by reaching the court , the court examined the documents from the legal aspect and saw that they were innocent of accusations of murder and guilty of other charges . consequently , we will appeal this sentence , '' he told cnn . early in the trial , morsy and his co-defendants were held in a metal cage in court . later , that cage was enclosed in soundproof glass . this is the first trial morsy was referred to after his removal from power . he is also standing trial in three other cases , including two on charges of espionage . the third trial involves a 2011 jailbreak . morsy and 18 other members of the banned muslim brotherhood allegedly broke out of the wadi-natroun prison , egyptian state-run media reported . in that trial , morsy and his 130 co-defendants , who include 71 palestinians tried in absentia , are accused of collaborating with the palestinian islamist group hamas and the lebanese shia group hezbollah to break into several prisons across egypt in january 2011 and facilitating the escape of morsy and 20,000 others . in may , morsy is scheduled to start a fifth trial -- this one on charges of insulting the judiciary . sarah sirgany reported from cairo ; holly yan wrote from atlanta . cnn 's bharati naik contributed to this report .",

'' but sabuhoro was n't finished . while talking to tourists who came to visit the volcanoes , sabuhoro came up with an idea to capitalize on their interest in the area , and provide work for former poachers . `` i started a tour company called rwanda eco tours , and i said for tourism to thrive in the country we need eco-tourism where tourists can give back to the community and then the communities will have an incentive to conserve the park . so we built a cultural village in 2006 -- before we finished , we had tourists visiting us . '' he says . `` in 2010 , we got $ 30,000 net income from the cultural village and put this back to different activities in the village level . '' sabuhoro , whose work with the cultural village has received international recognition , including a chance to briefly meet u.s. president barack obama as a young african leader , is now trying to take his idea further to other national parks across africa where poaching is causing similar problems . `` if we can work together , on a regional level , continent level , we can save these species , '' he says . `` because these are the last species that we have . and as human beings we ca n't afford to fail the wildlife . '' watch this : meeting the men who poach rwanda 's gorillas . watch this : flourishing community protects gorillas . more from african voices .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- ever had a headache so big , you felt like drilling a hole in your head to let the pain out ? in neolithic times trepanation -- or drilling a hole into the skull -- was thought to be a cure for everything from epilepsy to migraines . it could even have been a form of emergency surgery for battle wounds . but while there is still conjecture about the real reasons behind the mysterious procedure , what is known is that the implement often used to carry out the primitive surgery was made from one of the sharpest substances found in nature -- obsidian . obsidian -- a type of volcanic glass -- can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels . at 30 angstroms -- a unit of measurement equal to one hundred millionth of a centimeter -- an obsidian scalpel can rival diamond in the fineness of its edge . when you consider that most household razor blades are 300-600 angstroms , obsidian can still cut it with the sharpest materials nano-technology can produce . even today , a small number of surgeons are using an ancient technology to carry out fine incisions that they say heal with minimal scarring . dr. lee green , professor and chair of the department of family medicine at the university of alberta , says he routinely uses obsidian blades . `` the biggest advantage with obsidian is that it is the sharpest edge there is , it causes very little trauma to tissue , it heals faster and more importantly it heals with less scarring , '' he said . `` it makes for the best cosmetic outcome . '' he explained that steel scalpels at a microscopic level have a rough cutting edge that tears into tissue , a function of the crystals that make up the metal . obsidian , meanwhile , cleaves into a fine and continuous edge when properly cut . dr. green said he once helped documentary makers produce a program on surgical technology in ancient egyptian , setting up a blind test on the cutting power of obsidian . using cultured-skin burn dressing , a substance composed of skin cells , he made an incision with a modern scalpel and a parallel incision with an obsidian scalpel . the host of the program was then invited to look at the cuts under a video microscope and tell the difference . `` it was n't hard to tell the difference at all -- as soon as he turned around everyone in the studio was like ` ohhh ' , '' dr. green said . `` under the microscope you could see the obsidian scalpel had divided individual cells in half , and next to it the steel scalpel incision looked like it had been made by a chainsaw . '' modern obsidian scalpels look nothing like the decorative flint-knapped knives of neolithic man , often resembling their modern counterparts in everything except for the blade edge , but dr. green said they are a very different animal . `` the feel is very different because obsidian has no ` bite , ' '' he said . `` if you look under the microscope at a steel scalpel edge it looks almost like a saw , it has teeth , whereas obsidian is smooth even microscopically . `` it 's a very different feel to work with and you have to practice before you start using it in surgery . `` you also have to be careful not to nick yourself with it because you do n't even feel it ! '' and dr. green believes incisions made with these blades heal faster . he said a colleague who needed a mole removed agreed to undergo an experiment where half the procedure was carried out with an obsidian scalpel and the other half was removed with steel . `` what 's really fun is seeing it heal , '' he said . `` four weeks later the difference was quite remarkable -- there was very much a difference in scarring . '' in germany , the manufacturer fine science tools produces obsidian scalpels which can be used in situations where the patient may have an allergy to steel or metal . `` for studies where trace metals from ordinary scalpel blades can not be tolerated , these very special obsidian scalpels may provide the answer , '' the company says . at $ 99 per scalpel -lrb- $ 107.40 -rrb- , they represent a considerable saving on their diamond cousins which the company prices at $ 712.50 -lrb- $ 772.60 -rrb- . but there has been little academic research into the efficacy of obsidian blades compared to steel scalpels , and they do have disadvantages : obsidian scalpels are not food and drug administration -lrb- fda -rrb- approved , and they are extremely brittle and prone to breaking if lateral forces are applied -- meaning they are unlikely to ever be in widespread use . dr. green , whose scalpels were manufactured for him by an expert flint-knapper and archaeologist errett callahan , concedes the stone age scalpels are not for everyone . `` if it was let loose on the market there 'd be far too many injuries from it , '' he said . `` it 's very fragile and it 's very easy to break pieces off .

'' `` working on film sets was really important to magnum , and all of the photographers working with magnum in the '50s did films , '' says jacob , now the mcevoy family curator for photography at the smithsonian american art museum . not only did the work pay off financially , but the photographers also established relationships with members of the industry , he said . and the stars and directors knew what they were getting : some of the best in the field . photographers such as haas were entrusted to bring their talent and style to the work . the photographers `` are definitely producing work for posterity , that very much has their own fingerprint on it , '' jacob said . such distinction is obvious from looking at haas ' work -- some of which is as famous as the movies he worked on . there 's a striking picture of orson welles in 1949 's `` the third man , '' hemmed in by the darkness in a way that suggests the shadowy themes of the classic film . another , of gregory peck and chuck connors in 1958 's `` the big country , '' is as dramatic as any full-scale movie duel . -lrb- westerns were a specialty . -rrb- . but haas also has a way of documenting the artificiality of film work , whether it 's capturing the sprawling , workaday set of 1965 's `` the greatest story ever told '' or snapping a relaxed picture of barbara streisand as dolly levi in 1969 's `` hello , dolly ! '' social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . the former is particularly interesting : an image of actors splayed on crosses for the crucifixion scene , surrounded by ladders , a camera crane , a painted scrim and several casually dressed crew members . jacob observes that in each of haas ' images there 's an eye for the unusual . the black-and-white work from `` the greatest story ever told , '' for example , is almost prayerful , while the color images call attention to the artificiality of film . and some of haas ' other color images , especially his work for 1961 's `` west side story , '' fit in neatly with others in his catalog , as haas was known for an impressionistic blur of hues that jacob calls `` the haas effect . '' haas died in 1986 , and despite being celebrated during his life , his name is somewhat forgotten these days . jacob hopes that `` ernst haas : on set '' reminds people just what a master he was . `` a lot of these are familiar images , but you do n't necessarily associate them with haas , '' he said . `` on the other hand , people who know haas well do n't actually know this work , because it was work for hire and was n't ever put together in this way before . '' ernst haas was an austrian photographer who passed away in 1986 . he was a member of magnum photos .",

'' recent tests have shown promise : '' a few years ago , in new mexico , we moved our big mobile terawatt laser to the top of a mountain and we shot it up into the atmosphere , trying to trigger lightning . we did n't , but we could see some small discharge , lightning , within the cloud . you know , 90 per cent of the lightning discharge are intra-cloud , not against the earth . so , we are still working on that , but there is hope . '' controlling lightning , or facilitating its discharge in a desired location , would help reduce the costs associated with lightning damage -- they run into the billions of dollars each year , adding to thousands of people injured or killed by lightning strikes . affecting the weather could also turn out to be one of our best bets at limiting the impact of climate change . professor wolf reckons lasers could be used to `` repair '' the weather , reducing the occurrence of hurricanes , thunderstorms , flooding , and drought . but his laser technology can look way beyond the clouds : `` there are potential applications in the biomedical field : by changing the color of the laser , we could identify and selectively kill cancer cells , with little or no collateral damage . '' yet another potential application to add to that list : `` every time you think you have done everything you can with lasers , something new comes up : it 's quite amazing . ''",

'' moschetto ,54 , pleaded not guilty to all charges wednesday . he was released after posting $ 2 million bond and surrendering his passport . zelin said that his next move is to get dr. moshetto back to work . `` he 's got patients to see . this man , while he was in a detention cell , the only thing that he cared about were his patients . and amazingly , his patients were flooding the office with calls , making sure that he was ok , '' zelin said . two other men -- identified as james chmela , 43 , and james kalamaras , 41 -- were named as accomplices , according to prosecutors . they pleaded not guilty in nassau county district court , according to authorities . both were released on bail . a requests for comment from an attorney representing chmela was not returned . it 's unclear whether kalamaras has retained an attorney . police officers allegedly discovered approximately 100 weapons at moschetto 's home , including hand grenades , high-capacity magazines and knives . many of the weapons were found in a hidden room behind a switch-activated bookshelf , according to prosecutors . the investigation began back in december , when undercover officers began buying heroin and oxycodone pills from moschetto in what was initially a routine investigation into the sale of prescription drugs , officials said . during the course of the undercover operation , however , moschetto also sold the officers two semiautomatic assault weapons as well as ammunition , prosecutors said . moschetto allegedly told officers during one buy that he needed dynamite to `` blow up a building . '' he later said he no longer needed the dynamite because a friend was setting fire to the building instead . kalamaras and chmela are believed to have taken part in the arson , according to prosecutors . `` the fire damaged but did not destroy the office of another cardiologist whose relationship with dr. moschetto had soured due to a professional dispute , '' according to the statement from the district attorney 's office . moschetto allegedly gave an informant and undercover detective blank prescriptions and cash for the assault and killing of the fellow cardiologist , according to prosecutors . he also requested that the rival 's wife be assaulted if she happened to be present , authorities said . `` he was willing to pay $ 5,000 to have him beaten and put in a hospital for a few months , and then he said he would pay $ 20,000 to have him killed , '' said assistant district attorney anne donnelly , according to cnn affiliate wcbs .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- jackson gordon is no ordinary 21-year-old . by day he is an industrial design student at philadelphia university , but gordon has another side to him -- a side altogether darker , tougher and more enigmatic . hanging in his workshop gordon has a full suit of armor plating , cape and cowl -- matte black and built to stop a knife . gordon has an alter ego : the dark knight himself , batman . you might expect his origin story to be cloaked in mystery , but speaking to cnn gordon is quick to explain how the transformation took place . gordon says his calling came five years ago when he began experimenting with cosplay . `` previously i 'd been involved with costume making ... i 'd made a version of the batsuit from christopher nolan 's ` dark knight trilogy ' and i really liked that suit , '' gordon says . but , as elaborate as his design was , it lacked the functionality or the authenticity of the genuine article . `` i was frustrated every time i wore it , '' gordon explains . `` it really limited my mobility and i did n't like that -- it did n't go with the character . '' in september 2014 he bit the bullet , deciding `` to do another one that would n't inhibit my mobility and would actually provide protection and function more like batman 's actual suit . '' the batsuit had to be strong -- tough enough to withstand the stab or slash of a knife , the impact of a punch or a baseball bat , but light and articulate enough to make it practical . striking such a balance required expensive materials , and they did n't come cheap . gordon therefore fired up a kickstarter campaign . he `` did n't really think anyone would fund it or even be interested in it '' -- he raised $ 1,255 in 6 days . `` it was a little surprising , '' gordon demurs . writing out his shopping list , it was important that `` everywhere , even places without armor plating , had some sort of protection . '' kevlar was sourced as the base fabric , making it `` cut and slash resistant to bladed weapons , but breathable and wearable all day . '' eschewing conventional materials , gordon opted for a form of memory foam , built around key areas to `` squish and compress , '' dissipating the impact of blows . after much experimenting with `` polycarbonates and extruded pvc materials , '' 1/4 '' kydex -lrb- or abs -rrb- plastic formed the tough armor plates , located on the torso , forearms and shins . stab resistant , gordon says `` it can take anything but a gunshot . '' the cowl was more problematic , being `` nearly impossible '' to craft out of the same materials within the limits of his workshop . gordon therefore took a mold of his head using sintra plastic , `` working on top of that with different sculpting clays and soft plastics to get it into a recognizable batman shape . '' using a two part box mold gordon was able to create a `` silicone jacket '' of this , into which liquid polyurethane was poured , forming the final , `` durable and functional '' cowl . gordon -lrb- who does n't appear to be related to gotham city 's police commissioner , james gordon -rrb- is also an expert in shaolin kung fu : he is both brains and brawn , a cross between bruce wayne and batsuit designer lucius fox from nolan 's batman trilogy . legendary , the production company behind the films , has taken note of his design and given it their seal of approval . the batsuit has made appearances at conventions and proved a showstopper among his fellow students and the faculty . `` people love the theatricality of it , '' its designer says . that the product so closely mimics dc 's fantastical comic book creation has had resonance . he has already begun manufacturing the cowls for the public , with `` fully adjustable '' jackets going up for sale on his site armatus design `` in the next couple of weeks . '' the jackets have received particular attention . gordon has received `` easily over 50 requests from people , '' and not just from the cosplay community . `` they range from recreational use to martial artists ... but also motorcycle and all terrain vehicle riders who want protective gear and prefer the look and functionality of -lsb- gordon 's -rsb- suit . '' perhaps because of their versatility and the small matter of copyright issues , those that go on sale will not feature the iconic bat symbol . gordon says his fledgling business will remain small whilst he 's at university -- he has to finish he studies after all , and wo n't be using the project towards his degree credits . for now the batsuit and armatus design will remain a one man operation : such is the life of a superhero .",

    "article": "washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- a year after isis became a household name in america , using brutality and savvy propaganda to challenge al qaeda and its affiliates for jihadist adherents , u.s. prosecutions of would-be recruits have exploded . the flurry of arrests -- at least 25 people have been detained since january -- is a sign that complicated , manpower-intensive investigations begun when isis started seizing swaths of territory a year ago are finally being completed . but they also highlight the unique challenges that isis poses in comparison with al qaeda , which has attracted fewer u.s.-based recruits . like a new rock band storming the music charts , isis has benefited from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda , law enforcement officials said . the group quickly reached early recruits through videos that showcased the fear its adherents instilled in nonbelievers . at first , most of the recruits were self-starters -- people radicalized on their own from consuming isis propaganda from youtube videos and other social media . much of the propaganda comes in the form of slick movie trailer-style videos , some glorifying brutal practices such as the beheading of anyone who isis leaders decide does n't comport with their medieval brand of islam . but once those initial western recruits arrived , living in the self-declared isis caliphate spanning parts of syria and iraq , they started to directly entice friends and other contacts back home to join them . in minnesota , nine men have been charged as part of an alleged cell of recruits linked to american abdi nur , who turned up fighting with isis in syria in 2014 and began to appeal to his friends to come to the middle east . `` each one of those folks who makes it over there has the capability to reach out back to their contacts back here , '' a senior u.s. counterterrorism official said . it 's a phenomenon observed in norway and other european nations , where clusters of young people have been lured to isis . and the isis recruiters have an easier path to drawing supporters than al qaeda has had . a decade ago , that group 's recruits faced formidable obstacles trying to get to training camps deep in hard-to-reach areas of afghanistan and pakistan 's tribal region . few westerners went through the trouble . minneapolis men allegedly trying to join isis highlight role of american recruiter . today , isis occupies much more accessible territory , mostly reachable through turkey . istanbul 's airport has easy connections to western europe and much of the rest of the world . from there , turkey 's modern infrastructure offers quick access to the border regions where smugglers can help jihadis get across to syria . the informal recruitment networks and ease of travel have presented a difficult puzzle to intelligence and counterterrorism officials , who are used to tracking networks of facilitators and fundraisers that funnel recruits eastward . `` it 's harder for us to pick up on , '' the u.s. counterterrorism official said of the peer-to-peer recruitment , which is well below the radar . how isis is luring westerners . before isis , investigators could often focus on radicalizing mosques and clerics to figure out those networks . al qaeda recruitment focused on attracting radicals who were motivated to join the fight to protect islamic holy lands . much of the recruitment occurred in countries with strong conservative islamic histories , including saudi arabia and yemen , u.s. officials said . in contrast , isis takes a somewhat secular approach , portraying how much better life purportedly is in the caliphate as compared to the corrupt west . and people attracted to isis ' marketing run the gamut from rich to poor , educated to dropout , male to female , teenaged to middle-aged . there are signs western recruits have risen to high levels in the isis organization , with their influence reflected in the latest propaganda , counterterrorism and intelligence officials said . the english is proper , with fewer grammatical and spelling mistakes . and while the large number of arrests show that law enforcement officials are succeeding in their disruption efforts , it also means that u.s. authorities do n't see the lure of isis receding any time soon . `` we are opening cases quicker than we are closing them , '' the u.s. counterterrorism official said . who has been recruited to isis from the west ?",

'' when she gets ahead of her work , she packs her camera and microphones , jumps on a plane and interviews presidents instead . born in california to a nigerian father and a mauritian mother , oduwole is often described as `` the world 's youngest filmmaker . '' aged 12 , she already has four documentaries under her belt -- all of which focus on african issues . it all started three years ago when oduwole decided to enter a school documentary-making competition with a film about the ghana revolution . jerry john rawlings -lrb- ghana -rrb- . john kufour -lrb- ghana -rrb- . joyce banda -lrb- malawi -rrb- . jakaya kikwete -lrb- tanzania -rrb- . rajkeswur purryag -lrb- mauritius -rrb- . uhuru kenyatta -lrb- kenya -rrb- . goodluck johnathan -lrb- nigeria -rrb- . salva kirr mayardit -lrb- south sudan -rrb- . ellen johnson sirleaf -lrb- liberia -rrb- . jorge fonseco -lrb- cape verde -rrb- . portia simpson miller -lrb- jamaica -rrb- . thomas thabane -lrb- lesotho -rrb- . ralph gonsalves -lrb- st vincent & grenadines -rrb- . denzil douglas -lrb- st kitts & nevis -rrb- . after this first foray into filmmaking , oduwole was bitten by the director 's bug and quickly wanted to make more movies . she turned to the web to find the tools she needed and got involved in the entire filmmaking process . `` as i edit , produce , set up and write the scripts for my documentaries , i have to learn a lot of things , '' says oduwole , who is self-taught and uses online editing and voice software . her second outing , `` educating and healing africa out of poverty , '' looked at the creation of the african union in 1963 . she followed it up in 2014 with her movie `` technology in educational development . '' but it was her most recent project that catapulted her to international recognition . released late last year , `` a promising africa '' -lrb- watch trailer below -rrb- is the first in an ongoing series which will profile five african nations , starting with her father 's homeland of nigeria . `` i 've interviewed 14 heads of state and a few of those include the president of tanzania , liberia , kenya , south sudan , nigeria and cape verde , to name a few , '' says oduwole . `` i 've also been able to interview business leaders like my friend mr aliko dangote . '' to date , `` a promising africa '' has received a limited-release on the big screen in five countries -- nigeria , ghana , south africa , uk and japan . the young trailblazer , who was named by business insider as one of world 's 100 most powerful individuals last year , delightedly recalls seeing her film on the big screen and walking the red carpet in lagos . `` i 'm hoping that when people see these documentaries they will see africa is full of positive things -- not just the things that are on the news like war , famine , disease , '' she says . `` i want to show them there is a lot more to africa than what we see on the news -- there 's dancing , music , great culture and more . '' although she 's just 12 , oduwole , who is home-schooled through an online californian system , is already a 9th grader -- two years ahead of the rest of the kids her age . her mother , patricia , has a full-time job as a computer engineer , whilst her father , ademola , has taken time off his work in the tourism sector to help organize a lot of what zuriel and her three other siblings are doing . `` there really is a lot happening in our household but somehow we make it work , '' says patricia oduwole . in addition to her documentary work , oduwole has also become something of an education advocate . she travels to different african countries and the diaspora on a regular basis to talk to students about the importance of education . so far , through her side project `` dream up , speak up , stand up '' she says she 's had the opportunity to talk to 21,000 children in nine countries . `` girl 's education is important because on the african continent , where there are not as many resources , the boys are the first -lsb- to get an education -rsb- , '' says oduwole . `` the boys go to school and get an education while the girls stay at home . and those girls are n't educated and have fewer options in life when they get older .

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- lest we americans forget that -- in the wellsprings of our nation -- france bore the torch of liberty alongside us , our old ally has launched a reminder from across the atlantic 's waves . l'hermione , with three sail masts and bright royal blue and gold markings , is a painstaking replica of an 18th century french frigate that fought with the united states ' founding fathers in the war of independence . it set sail in france on saturday for virginia to retrace a journey through american history . in 1780 , the original hermione was assigned to a french nobleman , who fought as a general in george washington 's army against the british . his name : marie-joseph paul yves roch gilbert du motier , marquis de lafayette . lafayette carried prized cargo -- news from king louis xvi that france was throwing men , guns and treasure behind the colonies , according to a historical summary on l'hermione 's website . lafayette , who had been wounded in the revolutionary war had gone back to his homeland to lobby on behalf of washington , who was also one of his close friends . lafayette rejoined the fight on the front lines in virginia , while l'hermione did sea battle with its 32 guns against the english farther north . its coppered bottom was an innovation that made it cut faster through the waters . in chesapeake bay , it joined the blockade that led the british to surrender . after the war , lafayette returned to live in france . more than 200 years later , in 1997 , a group of people came up with the idea of reconstructing the frigate using the same building methods applied in the original . they claim the replica is the `` most authentically built tall ship in the last 150 years . '' after a year of testing , it set sail saturday to retrace lafayette 's journey , 235 years after the original , and france gave it a sendoff with the trappings of an act of state . `` l'hermione is a luminous episode of our history . she is a champion of universal values , freedom , courage and of the friendship between france and the united states , '' french president francois hollande said in a speech . president obama , in a letter to congratulate the launch , called france `` our nation 's oldest ally . '' `` for more than two centuries , the united states and france have stood united in the freedom we owe to one another , '' he wrote . l'hermione will ply across the atlantic for 27 days en route to yorktown , virginia , where it plans to arrive in early june . after that , it will show itself off in 12 ports along the east coast . it should be in new york city for the fourth of july , possibly sharing independence day fireworks with the statue of liberty . since 1886 , that gift from france -- also a reminder of our common bond -- has been america 's quintessential national symbol of freedom .",

'' the aclu of southern california issued a statement friday saying that it was `` deeply troubled '' by the images . `` while we applaud sheriff john mcmahon 's prompt decision to investigate the disturbing actions of his deputies , we believe more is needed , '' the organization said . `` too often the department has failed to address questions , including those raised by the aclu socal , about use of force and taser policies . '' coming soon : an app to report police brutality . the thursday afternoon incident began when deputies tried to serve a search warrant in an identity-theft investigation , according to the san bernardino county sheriff 's department . pusok fled in a vehicle , and deputies pursued him through the unincorporated area of apple valley , the town of apple valley and farther into the unincorporated area of hesperia , the sheriff 's office said in a news release . pusok abandoned his vehicle and fled on foot into steep , rugged terrain , with deputies pursing with off-highway vehicles and helicopters , the sheriff 's office said . `` within minutes , deputies received information that the suspect came into contact with a group of people near the deep creek hot springs and stole a horse . he fled on horseback on dirt trails , through very rugged , steep terrain , causing numerous injuries to the horse , '' the sheriff 's office said . a helicopter dropped deputies onto the ground , and as they approached pusok to make the arrest , he was thrown from the horse , the sheriff 's office said . the sheriff 's office said a taser was used on pusok but was ineffective because of his loose clothing . a deputy was injured when the horse pusok had been riding kicked him , the sheriff 's department said . two other deputies were treated for dehydration . the incident comes amid heightened scrutiny of police use of force after the 2014 deaths of eric garner in new york and michael brown in ferguson , missouri , and the recent shooting of walter scott in south carolina . in the california case , the fbi said the results of its investigation will be forwarded to the u.s. attorney 's office in the central district of california and justice department in washington to determine whether prosecution is warranted . did police use excessive force ? 3 cases in the spotlight . cnn 's sam stringer and cheri mossburg contributed to this report .",

'' assyrians belong to the rapidly dwindling christian population of iraq -- recent estimates from capni , the largest christian relief organization in northern iraq put the number as low as 300,000 compared with 1.5 million 20 years ago -- and many among them see the fight with isis as a final battle for survival against the islamists .

' demand families of soldiers captured by isis . still , the liberation of tikrit from the terrorist group , which is also known as isil and calls itself the islamic state , represented a significant victory for the iraqi government , which had tried -- and failed -- to retake the city many times before . iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi arrived wednesday to claim the victory , which took place a year after the city was first attacked by isis . al-abadi , who is also iraq 's top military commander , had announced the previous evening on iraqiya tv that the city was under the control of iraqi forces . iraqi forces continued to clean out pockets of resistance wednesday , said interior minister mohammed al-ghabban , who was also in the city . but he said the iraqi government would be in full control shortly . `` the enemy has been defeated , and it has lost all its capabilities , '' al-ghabban said . `` in the coming hours , the battle will end .

'' she 's famous enough by now to go by one name , but should she ? while clinton is arguably more widely known than any of her to-date opponents , she 's also a former u.s. senator and secretary of state . she 's not beyonc\u00e9 . and yet , despite her decorated career in government , we 've long called clinton by her first name , and her first name only , in a way we do n't do with men who have held similar , or even vaguely similar , positions of power . according to a university of utah study , clinton was called by her first name four times more than her 2008 rival , barack obama , and so it goes this time around . after all , rand 's also running for president . so is marco . when those guys declared , however , they got headlines that included their last names . there 's a very good reason for that . presidential candidates are not just professionals , but professionals declaring their candidacy for a position that many consider to be the most powerful in the world . a position that not only deserves formality and respect , but within a global context seems to require it . being president of the united states is a serious job . are there `` ted for president '' signs in our future ? unlikely . were we encouraged to `` vote for mitt '' ? nope . the u.s. army , meanwhile , is one of the most regimented organizations in the world , whose values put dignity and respect at top priority . cadets do n't call their commanding officers by their first names , even -- maybe especially -- if they 're women . so why are we all referring to the possible next commander-in-chief as if we 're part of her circle of close pals ? before you point to the fact that clinton is not the first clinton to cross this particular political threshold , the issue at hand is not one of practicality : the american public is smart enough to distinguish between this clinton and that clinton . george w. bush was n't the first in his family to run for office , and when he did , legitimate newspapers did n't go around noting the `` w '' -lrb- or even `` dubya '' -rrb- was up for the job . he was just bush , as he should have been , just as clinton is just clinton , a woman who has done a very good job distinguishing herself from her husband without the need to be referred to by her first name in order to avoid a case of mistaken identity . of course , the mononymity does n't seem to be unwelcome : sections of clinton 's website invite readers to `` like hillary on facebook '' and read about `` hillary 's story , '' while the campaign 's official hashtag appears to be #hillary2016 . her campaign chairman reportedly emailed potential campaign donors yesterday with the missive that `` it 's official : hillary 's running for president . '' perhaps clinton and her advisers believe the single name makes her more personable , and familiar . maybe it 's an effort to distance clinton from the other gender-based stereotype slapped on her the last time around , when she was `` the bitch '' to sarah palin 's `` ditz . '' but while we should like our president -- if not desire to have her as a personal friend -- it 's far more important to trust , and respect , her -- and that still requires a level of formality . it 's important for the american public to be able to imagine electing a leader not despite the fact that she 's a woman , or even because she 's a woman , but who , very simply , happens to be a woman . whether she endorses the idea or not , calling clinton by her first name serves to , at best , reinforce gender and workplace stereotypes -- that women need to be `` approachable , '' not abrasive or aloof , in order to get the job done and be liked while doing it -- and at worst , infantilize and put her in her place . there 's a reason , after all , that we address current and former presidents as mr. president when we meet them , and not `` hey , jimmy ! '' and if there 's a reason hillary clinton will be elected as our next president , it 's not because she let us call her hillary .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- the red cross on saturday called for an immediate 24-hour ceasefire in battle-torn yemen , saying many more people recently wounded in airstrikes and ground fighting will die if not tended to soon . the call came just before the u.n. security council met late saturday morning to discuss the situation in the arabian peninsula nation , where shiite rebels are pitted against external arab air forces and fighters loyal to yemen 's displaced sunni president . a pause was needed especially in and near the southern yemeni port city of aden , where intense fighting has happened in the past two weeks , the international committee of the red cross said . food , water , medical items and personnel need to get into these areas , the group said . `` otherwise , put starkly , many more people will die . for the wounded , their chances of survival depend on action within hours , not days , '' robert mardini , the icrc 's head of operations in the near and middle east , said . another red cross official said people are running out of food , water and fuel . `` medical supplies need to be here yesterday . the situation is difficult , `` said marie-claire feghali , a spokeswoman for the icrc who is in the capital , sanaa . `` we need to save the lives that can be saved . '' meanwhile , residents of sanaa , witnessed the fiercest saudi strikes since the air assault started last week . military facilities , including two bases , within the city limits have been targeted , three senior security officials in sanaa said . at the security council , russia submitted a draft resolution calling for a halt to the airstrikes that a nine-country regional coalition , led by saudi arabia , has been conducting against the rebels in yemen for more than a week . the meeting adjourned with no decision announced . one diplomat said the draft was missing what the envoy called key elements . it does n't call for the houthis to stop fighting , and it does not call for political talks between the belligerents , the diplomat told cnn on condition of anonymity . yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since houthi rebels -- minority shiites who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority sunni country -- forced yemeni president abdu rabu mansour hadi from power in january . the houthis put hadi under house arrest when they overtook sanaa in january . but hadi escaped in february , fled to aden and declared himself to still be president . houthis and their allies , including those loyal to hadi 's predecessor , then fought hadi 's forces in the aden area . hadi fled aden in late march , ultimately for saudi arabia , when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city . the conflict prompted saudi arabia , a predominately sunni nation and yemen 's northern neighbor , and other arab nations to hit the rebels in yemen with airstrikes . a saudi source told cnn that special forces supplied weapons and communication equipment to yemeni fighters in aden loyal to hadi . the houthis were retreating from areas in the center of the city , including the presidential palace there , the source said . saudi special forces help oppose houthi rebels in yemen , source says . the united nations said thursday that at least 519 people have been killed in yemen in the past two weeks . an additional 1,700 have been wounded . tens of thousands have fled to nearby somalia and djibouti . in aden alone , fighting has killed 58 people and injured 200 more in the past two days , yemeni security officials said . at least 24 of the dead were houthis . complicating matters in yemen is that al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -- not the houthis or hadi-loyal forces -- holds sway in the country 's east . aqap is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization . also late this week , photos circulating on social media purported to show senior al qaeda leader khaled batarfi -- whom yemeni defense officials said militants busted out of jail on thursday -- posing in a presidential residence in southern yemen . sunni islamist fighters freed batarfi with some 270 prisoners when they overran the town of al mukallah . on saturday , the french military evacuated 44 people , including some french nationals , from the eastern yemeni port city of balhaf . cnn 's don melvin , trey haney , david shortell and richard roth contributed to this report .",

'' on the outskirts of the base are the relics of the u.s. 's military involvement in a conflict that still continues to kill afghan security forces at an accelerated rate . suvs , even old american humvees -- now gifted to afghan police to drive around -- lie disabled by mine strikes . the americans were hoping the police could stack the vehicles here , assess their resupply needs , or cannibalize the damaged vehicles for spare parts . throughout , the surreal changes in how this war was , and continues to be , fought are omnipresent . years ago , the threat would have mostly been from insurgents taking potshots at an american base . now we are far from the threat , but another has taken its place . surrounding our crew at all times are `` guardian angels '' -- u.s. soldiers on guard duty , protecting their own from rogue afghan police or soldiers , trying to prevent the newest and most serious scourge -- `` green on blue '' attacks , in which afghan security forces turn their guns on americans . it is a strange experience to be protected from those who america seeks to hand the country over to . but this is how the war ended . not with ideological victories , or dramatic withdrawals , just the slow and deliberate stepping to one side .",

'' through an emission of sound waves , sensations are projected through the air and to the user . changes in air pressure are perceived as suspended tactile surfaces , creating invisible -- but tangible -- interfaces . this already sounds quite intriguing , but paired with another rising technology it has the potential to become a game changer . the rising tide of virtual reality seems unstoppable : facebook 's oculus rift and magic leap are leading the pack , but several other companies are readying devices in a field that could shake the foundations of electronic entertainment . but even though it is incredibly convincing , virtual reality completely bypasses the sense of touch : applying ultrahaptics ' technology to it would allow users to not just see the virtual world projected in front of their eyes , but to touch it as well . tom carter , ultrahaptics ' cto , sees potential in the merging of these technologies : `` the ability to put on your virtual reality goggles and not just explore visually and through your headphones , but also touch what you can see , is a really exciting possibility , '' he told cnn 's nick glass . creating buttons and shapes literally anywhere they 're needed opens up a slew of possibilities for more traditional devices as well . `` imagine the dashboard of a car having no buttons , no switches , no ugly controls : just a very nice , sleek dashboard . `` if you 're driving and you want to have the music up for example , you do n't have to take your eyes off the road , you just hold your hand out and the controls stick to your hand , so you can feel them . '' smartphones and other popular devices could also see benefits : controlling appliances in the kitchen , using tvs and computers in a style reminiscent of the movie `` minority report '' , or even snoozing the alarm in the morning would all become just a matter of waving your hands . -lrb- this probably would n't be the most virtuous application of the technology . -rrb- . several devices can already be controlled with gestures , but ultrahaptics add an extra layer of feedback , by generating the sensation of a force field : `` haptics is more than just the sense of touch . it 's really all of the information that you get from the sense of touch . what you 're feeling , what sort of pressure , the tactile sensation given by an object or surface . you also know where your limbs are and how they 're moving , all from the sense of touch . it 's all this information that cues how you 're interacting with the world , '' carter said . to create their invisible buttons , ultrahaptics use a small collection of ultrasonic speakers , concentrating the sound waves to a specific point . sound travels through air by creating a pressure differential , so by focusing several of these differentials to a target location , the result is a single localized spot of high pressure . `` if you put your hand in the way , it actually emits enough of a force on your hand to slightly displace your skin . `` we use that and control it to vibrate your skin , and give you this feeling . what you eventually get is a sensation of vibration on your hands , '' carter explained . with the current prototype , the smallest point that can be created is 8.5 millimeters in diameter , but the shape can be morphed into a surface , creating different textures over a single `` object '' by differentiating the pressure levels . other companies are working on similar projects , such as elliptic labs , and the interest around the technology already appears to be strong . ultrahaptics , who have already built several prototypes and have demoed the technology to the public at the last ces in las vegas , say they are working with 15 to 20 clients who are looking to incorporate tactile ultrasound into their products . `` we have everything from consumer electronics companies making things like speakers , radios , alarm clocks , through home appliance companies making cooker hoods , washing machines , to virtual reality in gaming companies . and we were very surprised at how keen the automotive industry is to work with us , '' carter said . `` i 'd like to believe that the first product featuring our technology will be on the shelves in a year , that 's our aim .

' '' twice , he nodded his head and smiled at me . it 's not unusual for his lawyers to slap him on his back and huddle before court begins , appearing at ease . they 've been representing him since june 2013 . there was an unfortunate moment . his mother once asked permission from a court officer to touch her son once the jury left the room . given an ok , she reached over the bar to him , took one of his hands in hers and kissed it . rules forbid contact . it did not go unnoticed by the family of victim odin lloyd . hernandez does not avoid looking in their direction . he glances at lloyd 's relatives . lloyd 's mother ursula ward , who is in court daily , appears to look right back at hernandez without expression from her usual seat on the end of a row . when one witness , a high school friend , testifies that hernandez once allegedly talked about carrying a gun , hernandez appears to glare at him . when his fianc\u00e9e takes the stand and testifies hernandez told her to ditch a box from their basement the day after lloyd 's slaying , his eyes are glued on her . she barely glances his way but does appear to say something as she passes the defense table on the way out . when kraft is asked to officially point out hernandez in court and describe what he was wearing , i watch hernandez look down at his shirt and tie as kraft detailed his outfit . when the team owner leaves the stand -- the same man who signed him to a $ 40 million bonus in 2012 -- hernandez turns and watches him walk out of the courtroom . would it be the last time he 'd see him in person ? on the last day of testimony when his defense rests its case , he smiles at relatives . but as he walks out the door this time , he does n't look back .",

'' santorum said . `` should the government force you to do that ? '' he said . `` and that 's what these cases are all about . this is about the government coming in saying , ` no -- we 're going to make you do this .

' '' gay rights groups , meanwhile , have used the outrage over indiana 's law -- as well as a similar one that arkansas gov. asa hutchinson signed into law -- and debate in at least 14 other states over similar measures this year to renew their calls for state laws that bar discrimination based on sexual orientation . sarah warbelow , the human rights campaign 's legal director , said the debate could shift to states like texas and south carolina , where similar bills have been introduced . she said tech companies like facebook and google are increasingly wading into the debate because they 're recognizing that `` nondiscrimination protections are critical to every area of their employees ' lives . '' cardinal timothy dolan , the archbishop of the catholic archdiocese in new york , said on nbc 's `` meet the press '' on sunday that the debate over religious freedom calls for a `` delicate balance . '' `` we 've got to make sure that the rights of conscience and the ability to publicly exercise one 's religion is also balanced with another good -- namely , the rights of people not to be discriminated against , '' he said . `` it 's easier to ignore religious freedom than it is , today , the more popular issues , '' dolan said . `` in a way , i appreciate the fact that we have political leaders like gov. pence that are saying , ` whoa , wait a minute . without questioning the rights of the gay community , we also have to make sure that the rights of the religious community are protected .

'' iranian president : we will stick to our promises on nuclear deal . netanyahu has lobbied hard for a deal that dismantles and disassembles iran 's nuclear infrastructure -- rather than limiting its usage or repurposing iran 's facilities -- but such stipulations were not part of the framework agreement . he has also called for the removal of sanctions to be tied to the reduction of what he characterizes as iran 's aggression in the region , not just its moves on its nuclear program . in the absence of both elements , netanyahu is calling the emerging deal a historic mistake . after an emergency cabinet meeting friday afternoon hours before the jewish holiday of passover , netanyahu said the agreement `` would pose a grave danger to the region and to the world and would threaten the very survival of the state of israel .

'' rouhani said his government kept its word to iranians when negotiating the framework deal , which was agreed upon thursday and sets parameters for talks that could lead to a comprehensive deal by a june 30 deadline . chief among them is that iran would keep at least some centrifuges and no longer face international sanctions . he thanked iranians for their patience and for `` resisting '' by standing up for the country 's rights . as to the rest of the world , the iranian president said he thinks most now realize that iran `` is pursuing peaceful objectives . '' that means trying to develop nuclear energy , not nuclear weapons , as many feared . that fear , combined with distrust of iran 's leaders , spurred the sanctions and the middle eastern nation 's isolation . `` we do not lie , '' rouhani said , vowing that iran will be true to its word , `` provided the other parties will implement their own promises . '' what iranians think of the deal . those promises include reducing iran 's stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98 % for 15 years and significantly scaling back its number of installed centrifuges . still , while it will be shrunken and centralized , iran 's nuclear program wo n't go away . what should happen -- assuming there 's a common view that tehran is doing as required -- is that countries will end their sanctions . that was non-negotiable for iran , with rouhani saying the deal shows his government 's commitment to removing a major `` obstacle ... for business '' by addressing the world 's worries about its nuclear program . `` we need economic productivity , employment for the youth and development of non-oil products , '' he said . `` thus our people can witness better things for their welfare . '' it wo n't be easy , of course , to get iran and the p5 +1 -- the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany -- on the same page regarding the nitty-gritty details of any final agreement , if there is one . after all , it took two extra days past a self-imposed deadline for the parties to reach a framework deal . what 's in the deal ? 7 key points . that agreement followed about a decade of often failed negotiations and deep-rooted acrimony , particularly between iran and the united states . those tensions have n't disappeared , nor is there any guarantee that talks wo n't fall apart again over the next three months . even as he applauded what he called a `` good deal , '' president barack obama pointed out thursday that `` if iran cheats , the world will know it . '' his government is also being pressed by israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu , who blasted the agreement friday as posing a `` grave danger '' by legitimizing iran 's nuclear program and making it easier for iran to develop nuclear weapons . on the iranian side , foreign minister javad zarif has acknowledged that `` mutual mistrust '' has long plagued talks . he notes iran still has `` serious differences with the united states , '' even after thursday 's agreement . still , rouhani expressed hopes friday the nuclear negotiations will change that by further opening up iran to the rest of world , including long-standing adversaries . `` we do shake hands with them . ... even those countries we have tensions with , we would like an end to the animosity , '' he said . `` cooperation and interaction would be in the interest of everyone .

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- every week in the heart of nima , a slum in the ghanaian capital of accra , families congregate at a local mosque . when the time comes , young girls say goodbye to their loved ones and part ways , filing up concrete steps leading up to the floor above . there , inside a large room dotted with brown tables , rows of flashing computer screens await for them . `` when the parents are praying -lsb- downstairs -rsb- , we are teaching the girls upstairs , '' explains tech entrepreneur regina agyare , who comes here every week to teach local teens how to code . agyare 's first visit to see the girls -- students at education project achievers ghana -- was in january 2014 . this was supposed to be a one-off seminar as part of her mentorship initiative `` tech needs girls '' -- however , the students proved quite a draw . `` i fell in love with them , so i decided to set up a coding club and started having regular sessions , '' says agyare , founder of software development company soronko solutions . more importantly , continues agyare , it offered the opportunity to show `` the community the value of educating girls . '' a predominantly muslim area in a largely christian nation , nima has one of the densest populations in accra . agyare says life is often challenging for many local girls , with some growing up without ever leaving the community . `` girls were being forced to marry early ; -lsb- denied -rsb- their right to go to school . most of their dreams and aspirations were limited to just what was around them . `` i was shocked ... i thought we had progressed as a nation . i thought we had gone past that . '' this , in part , was why agyare lent her support to achievers ghana . set up by local amadu mohammad , the non-profit organization supports 250 girls between the age of six and 18 , priming them for formal education through extracurricular classes in reading , math , poetry and information technology . its goal is to break through social barriers and provide nima with a generation of female role models , and so the group provides school funding to help the girls shape their own future . the project was bequeathed its classroom above the mosque it shares a building with , and agyare says the two work closely together . achievers ghana met initial resistance from local conservatives , but when the mosque 's chief imam sheik hussein abdul rahman championed mohammad 's vision , few maintained their reservations . now , with parents paying a nominal fee towards the running of the organization , it is in everyone 's interest that the girls succeed . fourteen months after her first visit , agyare 's coding class is well established . she has set up a mentor scheme as part of `` tech needs girls , '' recruiting and training women at university to act as role models for her younger students in nima . in each class , around 50 girls are taught html and run a blog called `` slum voices '' . `` i definitely feel -lsb- technology -rsb- has given them more of a voice , '' agyare says . `` i feel like it 's allowed them to express themselves and interact with others ... for them , it 's important to be heard . '' some girls had never used a computer before the classes began , but agyare 's even-handed approach has brought all her students up to the same standard . agyare insists that `` we do n't leave anyone behind . '' to that end , a few young male faces have found their way into her classroom . this was an accidental revelation , according to agyare . she details the story of one affronted boy . `` he wrote that he did n't like it when he saw girls learning about computers ... it was difficult -lsb- for him -rsb- to see girls being empowered ; he was n't used to that . '' agyare realized that by integrating genders in her classroom she could begin to confront gender expectations . for many boys the role of a girl is `` to be their wife , '' agyare explains , `` and she needs to be taken care of . '' however , by running mixed classes boys from an early age `` can learn to see a woman as a contributing person -lsb- within society -rsb- . '' now the hope is that many of the young students will be able to go to university -- and achievers ghana is working on a scholarship program to make the prospect attainable . agyare says the goal is not to turn every girl into software developers but to enable them to `` use technology in whatever field they find themselves . '' she adds : `` it would be great if we had some girls that decided to go on and study computer science , but really it 's about helping them reach their full potential ... and bring change to the community .

'' speaking of the allegations against him , dershowitz said tuesday : `` i hope that people will now understand that they were completely false and made up , and , nobody should believe them . '' buckingham palace , which in january emphatically denied any form of sexual contact between the duke of york and a victim it identified as virginia roberts , said prince andrew was informed of the latest developments . `` he is spending this week privately , before resuming his schedule of public engagements next week . further details will be announced in due course , '' the palace said in a statement . roberts ' attorneys were not immediately available for comment . the federal court filing alleged that `` doe 3 '' was forced to have sex with several men when she was a teenager . virginia roberts made the allegations in a civil motion filed earlier this year in u.s. district court in southern florida , joined by another unnamed woman . while roberts was not identified by name in the filing , her name was widely reported in the british news media , and buckingham palace included it in a statement . along with britain 's prince andrew and others , dershowitz was named in the federal court filing as one of the prominent people who had sexual contact with teenage girls through epstein . epstein , an investment banker , pleaded guilty some years ago in florida to a state charge of prostitution solicitation , but there were no federal charges after he and authorities signed a non-prosecution agreement . but some of epstein 's alleged victims are n't on board with the deal , thinking he should face stiffer charges and penalties . four of them took federal prosecutors to court , suing them to reopen the case because they believed their rights under the crime victims ' rights act were violated by the agreement . two of them entered the discussion in january , including the one described as jane doe 3 . the filing alleged she was a minor when epstein made her a `` sex slave '' and made `` her available for sex to politically connected and financially powerful people .

'' the celebrity lawyer and professor subsequently issued an adamant public denial , saying the case `` is all about money '' and `` completely made up . '' he went further in his court filings , including a sworn affidavit in which he said `` lawyers for jane doe # 3 ... leveled totally false and outrageous charges against me that have been reported around the world and threaten to damage my reputation irrevocably . '' `` never under any circumstance have i ever had any sexual contact of any kind , which includes massages or any physical contact whatsoever , with jane doe # 3 , '' he said . dershowitz said , for instance , that his wife and daughter accompanied him on his sole visit to epstein 's caribbean island as well as the one time he went to epstein 's new mexico house -- at which point it was under construction and no girls were visible . `` let me assert categorically , without reservation and with full awareness of the risks of perjury , '' he stated , `` that i did not ever , under any circumstances , have any sexual contact of any kind with jane doe # 3 .

    "article": "washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- the flight voice recorder aboard germanwings flight 9525 reportedly captured blaring cockpit alarms , warning co-pilot andreas lubitz to `` pull up '' and that `` terrain '' was ahead . but that was not enough to stop the aircraft from slamming into the french alps . with reports that lubitz apparently ignored those warnings , there are new calls from aviation experts to develop and deploy enhanced crash avoidance software that could take control of an aircraft away from a pilot and steer the plane to a safe altitude . the technology would work in a fashion similar to crash avoidance technology already used in automobiles . if a pilot is incapacitated or ignores audible warnings , the plane 's flight guidance software could take over and plot a course to a safe altitude . in cars , these avoidance systems sometimes deploy brakes or slow a car down to a safer speed , and help maintain safe distances from other vehicles . the idea is not new . in fact , more than 10 years ago , following 9/11 , airbus , the manufacturer of the doomed aircraft , was working to d evelop aircraft crash avoidance software with tech giant honeywell -- in part to prevent jetliners from being flown into large buildings or mountains . but the project was ultimately scrapped . a spokesperson for honeywell says the company has no plans to revive the project unless federal regulators demand it be put into cockpits or airlines ask for it . so far that has not happened . cnn also asked airbus about the project , but the company had no comment . former department of transportation inspector general mary schiavo says pilots , regulators and the traveling public have , so far , not bought into claims that computers can do it better . `` for any situation where you are relieving the pilot 's control of their plane , there has been pushback not only from the pilots , but from airlines . there are some sectors that believe that ultimately the pilot must maintain overall control of the plane and that that is your best bet for a safe flight . '' however , she adds , in the case of the germanwings crash , `` this technology , i believe , would have saved the flight . not only would it have saved this flight and the germanwings passengers , it would also save lives in situations where it is not a suicidal , homicidal pilot . it has implications literally for safer flight across the industry . '' pilots ' groups point to numerous instances where a pilot 's training and perhaps unconventional thinking actually saved lives . for example , in 2009 capt. c.b. sullenberger crash-landed u.s. airways flight 1549 into the hudson river in new york , after a flock of geese was sucked into both of its engines and the a320 lost all thrust . the formal national transportation safety board report on the crash said the main thing that contributed to the survivability of the accident was `` the decision-making of the flight crewmembers and their crew resource management during the accident sequence . '' in other words , when sullenberger decided to ditch the plane in the hudson , he saved the 150 passengers and five crew members on board . pilots say if a computer had taken over after it sensed the plane was headed for water , the outcome could have been very different . commercial airline pilot john barton says there are other considerations to take into account as well . `` in systems like this ... the control can not be taken back from the aircraft . or , indiscriminately the aircraft could be taken over on just a normal flight and they -lrb- cockpit crew -rrb- would n't be able to get control back . i think it is going to take a long time to operationally test this kind of technology before it is foolproof . '' he also worries that the autopilot software could be vulnerable to hackers . `` more and more people will come to know the technology . they will work on the technology and therefore there will be bad people that will be able to exploit that technology . that 's not a good thing . '' but in an incident like the germanwings tragedy , where a pilot is being blamed for the crash , schiavo says there must be additional safeguards and that this technology would be a start . `` most of the major commercial jetliner crashes in the last two or three years could have been saved with an override . '' barton says there are already plenty of safeguards in place in the united states . for example , he says , the federal aviation administration rule that two people must always be in the cockpit during a flight might also have saved the germanwings flight . that is a practice that several overseas carriers -- including germanwings and its parent company , lufthansa -- have now adopted . `` the solution to the problem simply is for the rest of the world globally to adhere to the standards that the united states has used forever , and that is sound hiring practices , safety and training and security practices . '' barton says .",
