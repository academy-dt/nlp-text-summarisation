    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- the palestinian authority officially became the 123rd member of the international criminal court on wednesday , a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in palestinian territories . the formal accession was marked with a ceremony at the hague , in the netherlands , where the court is based . the palestinians signed the icc 's founding rome statute in january , when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed `` in the occupied palestinian territory , including east jerusalem , since june 13 , 2014 . '' later that month , the icc opened a preliminary examination into the situation in palestinian territories , paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against israelis . as members of the court , palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well . israel and the united states , neither of which is an icc member , opposed the palestinians ' efforts to join the body . but palestinian foreign minister riad al-malki , speaking at wednesday 's ceremony , said it was a move toward greater justice . `` as palestine formally becomes a state party to the rome statute today , the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice , '' he said , according to an icc news release . `` indeed , today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace . '' judge kuniko ozaki , a vice president of the icc , said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the palestinians . `` as the rome statute today enters into force for the state of palestine , palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a state party to the statute . these are substantive commitments , which can not be taken lightly , '' she said . rights group human rights watch welcomed the development . `` governments seeking to penalize palestine for joining the icc should immediately end their pressure , and countries that support universal acceptance of the court 's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership , '' said balkees jarrah , international justice counsel for the group . `` what 's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice , not palestine 's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members . '' in january , when the preliminary icc examination was opened , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu described it as an outrage , saying the court was overstepping its boundaries . the united states also said it `` strongly '' disagreed with the court 's decision . `` as we have said repeatedly , we do not believe that palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the icc , '' the state department said in a statement . it urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations . `` we will continue to oppose actions against israel at the icc as counterproductive to the cause of peace , '' it said . but the icc begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as `` palestine . '' while a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation , it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides . prosecutor fatou bensouda said her office would `` conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality . '' the war between israel and hamas militants in gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead . the inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since june . the international criminal court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes . cnn 's vasco cotovio , kareem khadder and faith karimi contributed to this report .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- on may 28 , 2014 , some 7,000 people gathered in a stadium in china 's northwestern xinjiang region . but they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event . instead , the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits . armed soldiers guarded the exits . in the patently unfair , open air trial that followed , 55 people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed . three were sentenced to death . the public mass sentencing was part a china 's `` strike hard '' campaign against unrest in xinjiang , a campaign the government claims was launched to combat `` terrorism '' and `` separatism . '' but it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided , and often cynical , attempt to tackle crime and terrorism . today , amnesty international releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide . much of it makes for grim reading . in pakistan , the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific taliban attack on a school in peshawar in december . more than 60 people have been put to death since , and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows . iran and iraq executed people for `` terrorism , '' and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes . in a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before , governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee-jerk reaction to terrorism . other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates . jordan ended an eight-year moratorium in december , putting 11 murder convicts to death , with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime . in indonesia , authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety `` national emergency . '' six people have already been executed this year . a sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool . the rise was largely because of developments in egypt and nigeria , where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict . the simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both . there is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence , as united nations and other studies have repeatedly confirmed . it is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough . at amnesty international , we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades . thankfully , most of the world now appears to agree with us . the numbers speak for themselves . in 1945 when the united nations was founded , only eight countries had abolished the death penalty . today , 140 states are abolitionist in law or practice . last year , we recorded executions in 22 countries , down by almost a half from 20 years ago . despite the troubling developments we recorded last year , there was still much good news to be found . the number of executions recorded around the world dropped significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year , from 778 to 607 . this number does not include china , where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together , but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret , the true figure is impossible to determine . executions were recorded in only three countries in sub-saharan africa -- equatorial guinea , somalia and sudan -- and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter . the americas continued to be execution-free , apart from the united states . those governments that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history . they must join the vast majority of countries which have dropped the ultimate cruel punishment . fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task , but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment . with determination , i know that we can achieve this goal .",

'' theia is only one year old but the dog 's brush with death did not leave her unscathed . she suffered a dislocated jaw , leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe . the veterinary hospital 's good samaritan fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog 's treatment , but mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog 's care . she 's also created a facebook page to keep supporters updated . donors have already surpassed the $ 10,000 target , inspired by theia 's tale of survival against the odds . on the fundraising page , mellado writes , `` she is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw . i agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home . '' she is dedicated to making sure theia gets the medical attention she needs , mellado adds , and wants to `` make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again !

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- if you 've been following the news lately , there are certain things you doubtless know about mohammad javad zarif . he is , of course , the iranian foreign minister . he has been u.s. secretary of state john kerry 's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks . and he received a hero 's welcome as he arrived in iran on a sunny friday morning . `` long live zarif , '' crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street . you may well have read that he is `` polished '' and , unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues , `` jovial . '' an internet search for `` mohammad javad zarif '' and `` jovial '' yields thousands of results . he certainly has gone a long way to bring iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community . but there are some facts about zarif that are less well-known . here are six : . in september 2013 , zarif tweeted `` happy rosh hashanah , '' referring to the jewish new year . that prompted christine pelosi , the daughter of house minority leader nancy pelosi , to respond with a tweet of her own : `` thanks . the new year would be even sweeter if you would end iran 's holocaust denial , sir . '' and , perhaps to her surprise , pelosi got a response . `` iran never denied it , '' zarif tweeted back . `` the man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone . happy new year . '' the reference was likely to former iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who had left office the previous month . zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by ahmadinejad 's successor , hassan rouhami . his foreign ministry notes , perhaps defensively , that `` due to the political and security conditions of the time , he decided to continue his education in the united states . '' that is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the shah of iran , which began in 1977 , and during the iranian revolution , which drove the shah from power in 1979 . zarif left the country in 1977 , received his undergraduate degree from san francisco state university in 1981 , his master 's in international relations from the university of denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the university of denver in 1988 . both of his children were born in the united states . the website of the iranian foreign ministry , which zarif runs , can not even agree with itself on when he was born . the first sentence of his official biography , perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in tehran , says zarif was `` born to a religious traditional family in tehran in 1959 . '' later on the same page , however , his date of birth is listed as january 8 , 1960 . and the iranian diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 . so he is 54 , 55 or maybe even 56 . whichever , he is still considerably younger than his opposite number , kerry , who is 71 . the feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the alavi foundation , a charitable organization . the u.s. justice department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the iranian government to launder money and get around u.s. sanctions . but last year , a settlement in the case , under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in manhattan along with other properties to the u.s. government , did not mention zarif 's name . early in the iranian revolution , zarif was among the students who took over the iranian consulate in san francisco . the aim , says the website iranian.com -- which cites zarif 's memoirs , titled `` mr. ambassador '' -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently islamic . later , the website says , zarif went to make a similar protest at the iranian mission to the united nations . in response , the iranian ambassador to the united nations offered him a job . in fact , he has now spent more time with kerry than any other foreign minister in the world . and that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men , with help from other foreign ministers as well , try to meet a june 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in switzerland .",

'' `` you 'll feel it when you see it , '' diesel said . `` there 's something emotional that happens to you , where you walk out of this movie and you appreciate everyone you love because you just never know when the last day is you 're gon na see them . '' there have been multiple tributes to walker leading up to the release . diesel revealed in an interview with the `` today '' show that he had named his newborn daughter after walker . social media has also been paying homage to the late actor . a week after walker 's death , about 5,000 people attended an outdoor memorial to him in los angeles . most had never met him . marcus coleman told cnn he spent almost $ 1,000 to truck in a banner from bakersfield for people to sign at the memorial . `` it 's like losing a friend or a really close family member ... even though he is an actor and we never really met face to face , '' coleman said . `` sitting there , bringing his movies into your house or watching on tv , it 's like getting to know somebody . it really , really hurts .

'' his comments come as democrats and republicans spar over the framework announced last week to lift western sanctions on iran in exchange for the country dropping from 19,000 to 5,060 active centrifuges , limiting its highly enriched uranium , and increasing inspections . president barack obama endorsed the deal , saying it was better than the alternatives . but gop contenders for the party 's 2016 presidential nomination lambasted it , saying it gave iran too much flexibility . on sunday , the sparring continued . one senate democrat said netanyahu needs to `` contain himself . '' and a top republican said almost any of obama 's successors as president `` could do better . '' netanyahu 's most recent argument against the iran nuclear deal was similar to the one he 'd made in a march trip to washington , when he addressed a joint session of congress -- fueling a republican push to have the deal sent to congress before it 's implemented . `` it does not roll back iran 's nuclear program . it keeps a vast nuclear infrastructure in place . not a single centrifuge is destroyed . not a single nuclear facility is shut down , including the underground facilities that they built illicitly . thousands of centrifuges will keep spinning , enriching uranium , '' netanyahu said sunday . `` that 's a very bad deal . '' netanyahu said iran is a country of `` congenital cheating '' and that it ca n't be trusted to abide by the terms of the deal , which lasts 10 years with some provisions extending well beyond that . he said his opposition has little to do with his frosty relationship with obama . `` i think that we can have a legitimate difference of opinion on this , because i think iran has shown to be completely distrustful , '' netanyahu said . democratic sen. dianne feinstein of california , meanwhile , said she wishes netanyahu `` would contain himself . '' the top-ranking democrat on the senate intelligence committee said negotiators working on the deal -- from iran and the united states , as well as russia , china , britain , france and germany -- are `` on the cusp of something that can be workable . '' `` it 's a framework . it has to be wrapped into a final agreement . there still can be some changes , '' feinstein said . `` but i do n't think it 's helpful for israel to come out and oppose this one opportunity to change a major dynamic -- which is downhill , a downhill dynamic in this part of the world . '' energy secretary ernest moniz defended the deal in an appearance on cbs ' `` face the nation '' on sunday , saying it would extend from two months to one year the `` breakout '' time period -- the length of time it would take iran to build a nuclear bomb . he said it also allows for the `` almost instantaneous recognition of any attempt to evade the deal . '' `` we have blocked all of these pathways to a bomb , '' he said . sen. lindsey graham , r-south carolina , said on `` face the nation '' that the best option for the united states is to keep current sanctions in place for two more years and then have a `` new crack at it with a new president that does n't have the baggage of obama . '' and he said the alternatives to obama on both sides -- with the exception of sen. rand paul of kentucky , who 's called for a less active u.s. role overseas -- would likely strike a better deal . `` hillary clinton would do better . i think everybody on our side , except , maybe , rand paul , could do better , '' graham said .",

'' the lhc generates up to 600 million particles per second , with a beam circulating for 10 hours , traveling more than 6 billion miles -lrb- more than 10 billion kilometers -rrb- -- the distance from earth to neptune and back again . at near light-speed , a proton in the lhc makes 11,245 circuits per second . it took thousands of scientists , engineers and technicians decades to devise and build the particle accelerator , housed in a tunnel between lake geneva and the jura mountain range . the purpose of the lengthy project is to recreate the conditions that existed moments after the `` big bang '' -- the scientific theory said to explain the creation of the universe . by replicating the energy density and temperature , scientists hope to uncover how the universe evolved . our current , limited , knowledge is based on what 's called the standard model of particle physics . `` but we know that this model is not complete , '' dr. mike lamont , operations group leader at the lhc , told cnn in march . the burning questions that remain include the origin of mass and why some particles are very heavy , while others have no mass at all ; a unified description of all the fundamental forces such as gravity ; and uncovering dark matter and dark energy , since visible matter accounts for only 4 percent of the universe . the lhc could also question the idea that the universe is only made of matter , despite the theory that antimatter must have been produced in the same amounts at the time of the big bang . cern says the energies achievable by the lhc have only ever been found in nature . the machine alone costs approximately three billion euros -lrb- about $ 3.3 billion -rrb- , paid for by member countries of cern and contributions by non-member nations . the organization also asserts that its guidelines for the protection of the environment and personnel comply with standards set by swiss and french laws and a european council directive . scientists and physics enthusiasts will be waiting with bated breath as the lhc ventures into the great unknown . `` after two years of effort , the lhc is in great shape , '' said cern director for accelerators and technology , fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick bordry . `` but the most important step is still to come when we increase the energy of the beams to new record levels .

'' saudi arabia signed off on letting the icrc into yemen via two aircraft -- one with medical supplies , the other with workers . but flying in will be hard , since most airlines have canceled their flights , and airstrikes have taken out many airfields . on monday , the flight loaded with 48 tons of medical supplies was grounded in djibouti , feghali said . the icrc is hoping to fly out in a day or two . following the icrc 's call , on saturday the u.n. security council discussed the humanitarian situation at russia 's behest . moscow submitted a draft resolution calling for a halt to the airstrikes by the nine-country regional coalition . the meeting adjourned with no decision announced . one diplomat said the draft was missing key elements . it did n't call for the houthis to stop fighting or for political talks between the belligerents , the diplomat told cnn on condition of anonymity . yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since houthi rebels -- who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority sunni country -- forced hadi from power . the houthis put hadi under house arrest when they overtook sanaa in january . but hadi escaped in february , fled to aden and declared himself to still be president . houthis and their allies , including those loyal to hadi 's predecessor , then fought hadi 's forces in the aden area . hadi fled aden in late march , ultimately for saudi arabia , when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city . the conflict prompted saudi arabia , a predominately sunni nation and yemen 's northern neighbor , and other arab nations to intervene with force . the houthis are allied with iran , saudi arabia 's bitter rival across the persian gulf , and riyadh does not want an proxy of iran in power on its border . complicating matters in yemen is the fact that al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -- not the houthis or the forces loyal to hadi -- holds sway in the country 's east . aqap is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization . it has taken advantage of the chaos to overrun one city and break prisoners out of jail . hadi 's government had cooperated with the united states to fight aqap , but with the houthi takeover , that arrangement has evaporated , and the terror group operates generally unchecked .",

'' cassandra was diagnosed with hodgkin lymphoma in september and medical experts gave her an 85 % chance of survival if treated with chemotherapy . without it , doctors said at the time , she was likely to die within two years . she started chemotherapy in november but ran away after two days , according to court documents , when she decided she did not want to put the poison of the treatment into her body . in december , a judge ordered the young woman to be under the custody of the connecticut department of children and families . at that time , she was admitted to connecticut children 's medical center in hartford and has remained there since then . doctors surgically implanted a port in cassandra 's chest to administer chemotherapy medications , which began in spite of legal maneuvers to halt them . cassandra is feeling well and is in good shape as far as her health is concerned , according to michtom . `` she 's seen in her case the side effects were n't bad , and she 's been well-treated by the nurses and doctors and does want to complete the treatment , '' he said . her treatment is scheduled to wrap up this month . michtom and taylor failed in their effort before the connecticut supreme court to make the case that cassandra was mature enough to make her own medical decisions . joette katz , the commissioner of the department of children and families , told cnn in march the agency is `` very pleased with cassandra 's progress toward a complete recovery . we understand how difficult this has been for cassandra and her family , but we have had full confidence throughout that the medical professionals involved in her treatment would be successful in saving her life .

'' while an saf superintendent said at a eulogy for the fallen commandos that their sacrifice had been worth it , controversy has dogged the botched mission in the philippines . the ipac report argued that the `` single-minded focus '' of authorities on killing marwan has threatened the peace agreement with the milf , which is yet to cross the final hurdle of being passed into law by the philippines congress . `` the best chance the southern philippines has ever had for peace may now be in jeopardy , '' read the report , which argued that the mamapasano fiasco was the result of a misguided emphasis on killing marwan . the report argued that , although marwan had aided terror attacks and provided funds and equipment to milf and abu sayyaf , he was not `` the master bomber that his reputation suggested . '' yet for the philippines authorities and their u.s. allies , killing marwan had become such a priority that security forces bypassed the mechanisms that had been established to alert the milf to such operations , for fear of word leaking to their target . the report quoted an anonymous indonesian associate of marwan 's who described the malaysian as `` a little snake who has been blown up into a dragon .

'' taiga ishikawa , tokyo councillor and the first male gay local assembly member in japan , told cnn the ordinance was a `` big first step for the protection of human rights . '' he called the decision `` happy '' but said that it must go alongside education about alternative lifestyles . he said that the most important part of today 's announcement is that it `` should be actually put into practice , as should education for understanding -lrb- lgbt individuals -rrb- especially they suffer as they find out their sexuality when they are young . '' neighboring setagaya ward has indicated that it would look into following shibuya 's lead . however , former councilor ishikawa cautioned against taking the movement 's momentum for granted . `` to realize equal rights for gay couples , a national law has to be made , '' he said . while outright discrimination against the lgbt community is rare in japan , its effects can be hidden and gay people often find themselves at a disadvantage . many hide their sexuality from their employers , co-workers , families and friends . but the tide may be turning . a recent poll found that a slight majority at 52.4 % oppose gay marriage , but support amongst young adults in their 20s and 30s is as high as 70 % . an editorial in the asahi shimbun newspaper , which commissioned the poll , welcomed the shibuya decision , calling it `` a bold and important step forward . '' only traditional marriages are recognized under japan 's constitution , but the wording is vague enough to open it to interpretation , according to mari miura , a professor of gender and politics at sophia university in tokyo . `` the constitution does not rule out same-sex marriage , so an interpretation can be made that it is constitutional , '' miura told bloomberg business . while prime minister shinzo abe and the ruling liberal democratic party `` do n't like the idea of same-sex marriage , but at the same time the issue is gaining momentum . '' conservative groups were vocal in their opposition , with one , known as the network pushing for normalization of education , telling the japan times that granting same-sex couples the same rights as all other japanese citizens would degrade the `` familial system and practice that heterosexual unions have long preserved in human history . '' while shibuya 's registration system will be a first for japan , yodogawa ward in the western japanese city of osaka was the first in the nation to recognize and support the lgbt community . in 2013 the ward government pledged to give consideration to the issues that the community faced , and to train staff to accommodate needs specific to lgbt individuals . journalist chie kobayashi contributed reporting from tokyo .",

'' i have no doubt that under paul 's leadership , he would indeed take our country back -- in the wrong direction -- way back to a time when we were debating the civil rights act -- which paul has done since landing on the national stage ; when there was no department of education -- a department he thinks `` should be done away with ; '' when women did n't have choices -- choices paul seeks to limit in washington ; when dreamers were n't protected from deportation -- protections paul currently opposes . in his inept speaking engagements at historically black colleges and universities , he has come across as condescending and lacking basic cultural competency . but paul has also questioned the civil rights act , and even claimed that private business owners have a right to discriminate . when asked about the need for a more robust voting rights act following the supreme court 's dismantling of the law , paul dismissively remarked , `` we have an african-american president . '' when president obama stood with john lewis and other veterans of the civil rights movement in front of the edmund pettus bridge last month to mark the 50th anniversary of bloody sunday , he inspired us all by saying : `` with effort , we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity . ... with effort , we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge -- and that is the right to vote . '' america is better -- and we solve more problems -- with more democracy , not less . unfortunately rand paul has demonstrated that he disagree with that basic principle . paul tried once again from that stage in louisville to fashion himself as the one member of his party courageous enough to try to broaden republican appeal to constituencies they ignore year after year . but his record makes it very clear that his views are outdated , outside of the mainstream , and disqualifying for a man who wants to lead our country . the american people deserve a leader who wo n't disrespect their intelligence , who wo n't pander to them when it 's convenient , and who wo n't work to dismantle the progress we have made over the last five decades . what i heard today , did n't change the facts about rand paul 's record . the american people deserve better than rand paul .",

'' years ago , rock filmed a sketch for his `` chris rock '' show on hbo in which he detailed ways to avoid being beaten by police as a black man . besides obeying the law , he suggested bringing a white friend along for the ride . he did just that last year in a segment of `` comedians in cars getting coffee '' with jerry seinfeld . the two chat as seinfeld drives an orange lamborghini . and what happened ? they get pulled over after seinfeld goes a bit heavy on the gas . `` here 's the crazy thing , '' rock tells seinfeld as the police officer stops the duo . `` if you were n't here , i 'd be scared .

'' now , prosecutors have accused zhou of `` taking advantage of his posts to seek benefits for others and illegally accepting huge amounts of money '' during his long political career . his alleged actions have caused heavy losses to public assets and greatly harmed national interests , they added . zhou was notified of his legal rights during the investigation and his lawyer 's views were heard , according to a statement by the prosecutors . his case will be tried in tianjin , a city near the chinese capital , beijing . the president of china 's supreme court recently told reporters there would be `` open '' trials for accused former leaders like zhou . however , the charge of leaking state secrets may allow authorities to shield certain legal proceedings from public view in zhou 's case . zhou has not been seen in public since he attended an anniversary event at his alma mater in october 2013 . he was expelled from the communist party and arrested last december . state media have painted an intricate web of officials , cronies and tycoons -- some with alleged mafia connections -- orbiting around zhou before the crumbling of his power structure last summer . zhou and his family members were said to have accumulated enormous wealth , in a blatant exchange between money and power . he was also found to have affairs with multiple women and allegedly traded power for sex , state-run xinhua news agency reported last year . analysts have viewed his shocking downfall as a watershed moment in the secretive world of chinese politics , now ruled by president xi jinping . xi has been spearheading a massive anti-corruption campaign , targeting both `` tigers '' and `` flies '' -- high-ranking , and low-level , officials . zhou is by far the biggest tiger caught in xi 's dragnet to date . `` the important thing here is that xi has proven he 's powerful enough to break this taboo of never incriminating former politburo standing committee members , '' longtime political analyst willy lam , a professor at the chinese university of hong kong , said last year , when the government revealed its formal investigation into zhou . many observers also note zhou 's patronage of bo xilai , a former communist leader sentenced to life in prison for corruption in 2013 . bo 's spectacular downfall the year before -- complete with tales of murder , bribery and betrayal -- attracted global attention . state media have cited his subsequent conviction as a prime example of xi 's resolve to clean up the party . the former chongqing communist party chief 's supporters , however , have long called him a political victim -- the former high-flying politician was once considered xi 's main challenger for the top spot of chinese leadership . political watchers see similarities between the bo and zhou cases . `` the people being investigated for corruption are on the losing side of factional struggles , '' said lam , who has predicted a suspended death sentence for zhou .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- a year after its cannes debut and finally seeing a theatrical release , `` lost river '' is still causing quite a stir . booed at its premiere and mocked by reviewers , ryan gosling 's first feature as director has been divisive , to put it mildly . but there has been one shining light cutting through the fog of critical hyperbole : its setting , a besmirched and decaying detroit . wavering on the brink of annihilation , yet providing kindling for its own rebirth , the city is captured in all its waning splendor , the perfect backdrop for gosling 's post-industrial gothic . speaking about the film in london , gosling made clear that the city was at the heart of the project -- in fact , without detroit 's crumbling edifices there would be no film at all . gosling said that `` lost river '' began as a collection of speculative shots of the brewster-douglass projects , the first black social housing development in america and a place motown legends the supremes and boxer joe louis once called home . `` i heard -lsb- the authorities -rsb- were going to tear them down , '' gosling said . `` i had to shoot them before they did . '' taking time out between acting jobs , he ventured into the projects . `` i started shooting more and more , '' he explained , `` and then i realized that i was making a film . then i started writing -lsb- the script -rsb- during the process of filming . '' gosling 's affection for the motor city is longstanding , the actor growing up `` not too far away '' in cornwall , ontario . `` it seemed like everything cool came from detroit ... the whole american dream , '' he reminisces . `` the model-t , motown , the refrigerator ... '' now though he references `` 40 miles of dead neighborhoods , '' the city declaring bankruptcy . `` houses are burning and things are being torn down , '' he says , `` and within that there are families trying to hold on to their homes . for them it has become a nightmare and i wanted to make a film about that . '' the title itself alludes to a once thriving community now displaced , its homes at the bottom of a reservoir built with little concern for the residents -- man-made interference with untold social repercussions . speaking in broader terms , gosling argues `` there are lost rivers everywhere and we wanted to share the experience these people were having . '' on screen he paints a nihilistic image of wanton destruction ; torched properties and bulldozers jostling for our attention amid acts of extreme human violence -- sometimes self-inflicted . the director plainly states that as a location it `` was pretty dangerous . '' he describes `` an energy there that was threatening ... we had a very charmed experience -lsb- filming -rsb- . it worked its way into the fabric of the movie -- a tone of impending threat that was just there . '' however there are signs of humanity and regeneration amongst the chaos , on camera and off . for the film 's young protagonist , every raid on an unoccupied house offers copper piping waiting to be recast and ultimately reclaimed . similarly , gosling references the heidelberg project during the discussion , a community organization in the city 's mcdougall-hunt neighborhood , reimagining derelict buildings as giant canvases for budding artists . he recalls seeing `` one house covered with teddy bears , another covered in clocks ... people taking spaces and personalizing them . '' the city 's scope for urban renewal was clearly a draw . `` something really interesting is happening in detroit at the moment -- a rebirth . people redefining what they are , '' according to gosling . `` there 's a resilience there and an energy , and it 's exciting . '' as much as the visual content of `` lost river '' revolves around a maudlin preoccupation with dereliction -- and perhaps plays on the outside world 's perception of detroit -- aspects of the narrative suggest hope and the possibility of reincarnation for the city . gosling claims this paradox should exist when discussing detroit , and is precisely what the film is trying to convey . `` we want people to know that dereliction is happening there , but that it 's not only what is happening there , '' he argues . `` it does n't define detroit , it 's just part of what it 's dealing with right now . '' `` lost river '' receives a limited theatrical release in the u.s. and uk on april 10 .",

'' ... while our employee had the customer 's well-being in mind , the situation could have been handled differently . '' her cancer fight notwithstanding , sedway was in hawaii in time to celebrate her 14th wedding anniversary . still , on monday , she was on a plane to head east . then , according to her facebook post , an airline employee who saw sedway seated in the handicapped section asked her how she was doing . the second time she inquired , sedway wrote that she responded by saying she sometimes felt weak . that was followed by a call to a doctor , then her removal from the plane . egan , the alaska airlines spokeswoman , acknowledged that the carrier 's policy when someone has a medical issue is to call medlink , a group of er nurses and doctors . the idea , she explained , is that `` it is better to address medical issues or concerns on the ground rather than in the air , especially on flights to or from hawaii '' -- which in that case would last five-plus hours over open ocean . the decision to pull sedway from the flight was done with `` the customer 's well-being '' in mind , according to egan . still , that does n't mean it was the right decision . alaska airlines since apologized to sedway `` for the disruption this has caused , '' in addition to refunding her family 's tickets and paying for their overnight accommodations . '' even though she was stuck in hawaii , sedway made clear on facebook that this was a real `` disruption .

'' berman was shot in the head in her beverly hills home in december 2000 , shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the 1982 disappearance of durst 's first wife , kathleen mccormack durst . durst has long maintained that he had nothing to do with berman 's death or his wife 's disappearance . it 's not the first time he has been accused of murder . he admitted killing and dismembering his neighbor at a 2003 trial , but he was acquitted after arguing that he acted in self-defense . fbi agents have also asked local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where durst lived over the past five decades , a u.s. law enforcement official said . unsolved cases in vermont , upstate new york , the san francisco bay area and southern california are among those getting a new look , the official said . durst 's attorney , dick deguerin , said it 's a sign that authorities are desperate . deguerin has said durst has serious medical conditions . he is suffering from hydrocephalus , which required brain surgery a couple of years ago , deguerin said . doctors implanted a stent on the right side of his head , the attorney said . `` at the same time he was in the hospital , he had an operation on his esophagus to remove cancer . so he 's got some serious health issues . ... he 's lost a lot of weight . he 's not in good health , '' deguerin said . deguerin also said that durst is `` mildly autistic '' and has received treatment in the past from one of the country 's leading experts in asperger 's syndrome and autism .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- recently , a new york judge issued an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband completely via facebook . what exactly is `` service of process '' ? serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premised on one guiding principle : if you are going to sue someone , you should at least let them know about it . sounds simple , right ? in theory it is . in practice , it turns out people do n't like being sued . it also turns out that , to many defendants , procrastination of a lawsuit is a viable defense . just as you may avoid bad news in life , defendants tend to avoid process servers . once a defendant has been served , that means the judicial proceedings begin . unfortunately , that means defendants have an incentive to go `` off the grid '' . although every state is different , the law of service of process has evolved this way : the ideal and fairest way to notify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person , and have some proof that the person was the defendant . in-person service is not always possible , for obvious reasons . so , the law had to develop methods of alternate service , but carefully balance a defendant 's right to have notice of a lawsuit , against a diligent plaintiff 's access to court if a defendant is avoiding the inevitable . as reliable as the u.s. mail is , regular mail is not a reliable form of serving papers . not because the postmen ca n't be trusted ; they can . neither snow , nor rain , nor heat , nor gloom of night , will keep them from delivering those papers . instead , it 's defendants -- no wait , all of humanity -- that ca n't be trusted . every one of us has ignored mail or even pretended we did n't get it . defendants are no different . one form of alternate service is `` nail and mail '' service . this means that you take a hammer and nail , and nail the papers to the defendant 's front door . the problem with that is that many defendants are nomadic by nature . just because you find a house that a defendant stayed at , does n't mean he 'll be back there anytime soon . another , even odder form of `` service '' is service by publication . this is an almost laughable legal fiction . if you ca n't find a defendant , a judge might let you serve by publication . that means that a plaintiff can take out an ad in five point font for a week in an obscure publication , on the off chance you are reading the classified ads of the secaucus law journal looking for lawsuits against you . as laughable as serving someone by tweeting it sounds , it 's at least more rational than this antiquated method . at first blush , the idea of service by facebook seems to offend traditional notions of ensuring notification of a defendant of a case against him . when it comes to serving papers , however , `` traditional '' does n't necessarily mean `` good . '' service by publication or nailing paper to the door of an empty apartment is hardly reliable ; it 's just service of last resort . for those people who are concerned that being served papers will become a facebook announcement in a news feed , along with the photos of dinner or kittens , to be `` liked '' by all your gawking `` friends , '' we 're not quite there ... yet . while the older forms of alternate service were public , most electronic service takes the form of email . where email is n't available , it is facebook private messaging , which should be as private as email . that 's the form of service authorized by the court here . so for now , we 're not quite putting lawsuits on instagram ... but i would n't rule it out in the future . online service may be a new frontier , but it 's not unheard of . most of us exist more online now than we `` live '' in a particular condo , or mom 's basement . virtually everyone has a phone or access to the internet . not everyone has a lease or a mortgage . plus , online service has the added benefit of tracking . believe me , somewhere , some computer has already logged the fact that you read this article , how long you read it , and even how far down you scrolled before you got bored and bailed on the article -lrb- thanks for still being here , by the way -rrb- . in a way , maybe online service is long overdue . you can outrun a process server for a while , but sooner or later , all of us have to go back online -- and no human can outrun an email .",

'' wang told cnn that prosecutors had to decide whether to pursue the charges within seven days of the submission -- by monday . `` we hope that the prosecutors will not approve a formal arrest warrant , following the laws and standing up to pressure , '' he said . `` but nobody knows what to expect till monday ; we can do nothing but wait . '' the five were initially held on suspicion of `` picking quarrels and provoking trouble . '' wang said he did n't know why the charge against the women changed . `` neither should constitute a crime , '' he said . campaign group amnesty international said the new charge was less serious but still carried a maximum jail term of five years . `` the women were doing nothing wrong , nothing illegal . they were simply calling for an end to sexual harassment , '' william nee , china researcher at amnesty international told cnn . `` everything they were doing was in line with china 's own laws and policies . '' wang said that wei had been subject to lengthy cross examinations during her detention but was well the last time they met on march 31 . two of the women are said to be in poor health . he added that the charges relate both to the activities the women planned for international women 's day and earlier campaigns against domestic violence and for more public toilets for women . the five -- who are members of china 's women 's rights action group -- had planned to hand out stickers printed with slogans saying `` stop sexual harassment , let us stay safe '' and `` go police , go arrest those who committed sexual harassment ! '' on women 's day . the detention of wei , along with wu rongrong , li tingting , wang man and zheng churan has drawn harsh criticism from the international community . protests have taken place in several cities , including hong kong , that urge chinese officials to `` free the five . '' a social media campaign also uses the phrase as a hashtag . on monday , hillary clinton , former u.s. secretary of state , tweeted that the activists ' detention was `` inexcusable . '' her comment drew a rebuke from chinese authorities , who said public figures should respect china 's sovereignty and independence . maya wang , china researcher at human rights watch , said the activists were best known for their `` performance art '' style protests -- occupying public toilets to highlight long lines at women 's restrooms , donning blood-spattered wedding gowns to protest domestic violence and shaving their heads to protest against barriers to higher education for women . `` these activists epitomize the spirit of the times . they are young , confident , ready to challenge established norms , '' wang said . as china prepares to mark the anniversary of landmark un fourth world conference on women in september , it will be hard for authorities to justify detaining the activists , she added .",

'' one year later , a few things have changed . each of the missing girls has had a birthday in captivity . each is now a year older . nigeria 's current president , goodluck jonathan , was defeated in his campaign for re-election , in part , it is thought , because he failed to effectively combat boko haram . buhari , the incoming president , has pledged an aggressive effort to wipe out the group . but much remains unchanged , as well . boko haram still controls swathes of northeastern nigeria . according to unicef , 800,000 children have been forced to flee their homes because of the conflict between the nigerian military , civilian self-defense groups , and boko haram . amnesty international says women and children continue to be abducted . and it says boko haram continues to kill in large numbers . beyond that , more than 200 schoolgirls who had gathered one year ago to take their science exam are still missing . their families are still bereft . and tuesday on twitter , a hashtag was still trending : #bringbackourgirls .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- what would you do if a complete stranger asked you for $ 100 , or offered you an apple in a parking lot without explanation ? these are only two of the 100 challenges chinese-born , american-based jia jiang put himself up to when he decided to blog about `` 100 days of rejection '' , a project he launched after he quit his comfortable six-figure job to follow his dreams of being an entrepreneur at the age of 30 , just weeks before his first child was born . after his tech start-up was declined investment , jiang decided to confront his fear of rejection head-on . this led to his writing his book called rejection proof , part self-help and part motivational/autobiography , which is being released this week . famously , in 2012 on his third day of the project , jiang asked austin , texas , krispy kreme manager -lrb- jackie braun -rrb- to make him five interlinked donuts to mimic the olympic symbol . to his surprise , she rose to the challenge and his rejection request faltered . he shared his video and it went viral on reddit . before long , jiang -lrb- and braun -rrb- were invited on talk shows and jiang was being asked to speak at events across the us . jiang was even offered jobs as his project continued and his fame grew . that was n't the goal of the project though . `` i 'm really just a person trying to overcome my own fears , '' explained jiang . the project started out to help `` fix my own problems , and now i 'm helping others fix theirs , '' he said . `` the fear of rejection really holds people back . i 'm trying to demystify the idea of rejection . '' jiang , who as a child dreamed of being bill gates and has been viewed 7 million times on youtube , has found his entrepreneurial dream in a different role for the moment . `` my goal is to turn rejection into opportunity . i always thought it was something to run away from , but if we can embrace it , we can turn it into a lot more than an obstacle . '' 8 top tips in making rejection work for you : . 1 - the fear of rejection holds us back a lot more than actual rejection . by putting ourselves out there , the world will usually open itself up to you . though the world can seem cruel and cold , actually humans have a hard time saying no . so open yourself up , do n't be afraid to ask for something . if you fail , remember it 's not about you . 2 - rejection is more or less a numbers game . sometimes the most far-fetched idea gets a yes . if you talk to enough people , somebody will say yes to you . j.k. rowling went through 12 rejections to get her yes for harry potter and the philosopher 's stone . 3 - you can not use rejection to measure the merit of an idea . sometimes if you really want to change the world , getting rejection is a must . rejection is a human interaction with two sides . it often says more about the rejector than the rejectee , and should never be used as the universal truth and sole judgment of merit . 4 - do n't run away after a no . the most common thing we do when we 're rejected is we want to run because rejection is painful - you 're hurt , angry and you lose confidence . but actually if we know how to handle it , we can often minimize the chance of rejection . be confident , engaging , collaborate . i used all of these traits to maximise getting a yes . 5 - ask why ? when you get rejected you have to find out why . then spend time to find solutions to solve that why . sometimes through this process you learn there is something else you can ask for . ask for an intermediate position rather than the top position . 6 - set a number of how many no 's you can take . in his book , jiang helps his wife set out to get her dream job at google . he tells her that instead of thinking about getting a job , she needs to prepare herself for how many no 's she can take . in the end , she was offered a job at google . 7 - be invincible . by the end of his project , jiang said he felt he could ask anything from anyone and not have the pain of rejection . it was a gradual process - gradually my comfort zone expanded . it 's like a muscle , i could become stronger and stronger . 8 - stand tall and remember rejection is an opinion . people are who they are . a lot of people will reject you because of their mood , their education , their upbringing , and you ca n't change who they are . but you can stand confidently . innate confidence comes across . how missing sleep can damage your iq . the surprising benefits of doing nothing . 7 habits of highly ineffective people .",

'' for centuries , these plays and three dozen more by william shakespeare have formed history 's most heralded literary canon . but now they may have to make room for an addition to shakespeare 's famous oeuvre . new research indicates that `` double falsehood , '' a play first published in 1728 by lewis theobald , was actually written more than a century earlier by shakespeare himself with help from his friend john fletcher . the findings were published this week by two scholars who used computer software to analyze the writings of the three men and compare it with the language of the `` newer '' play . `` the match between the ` double falsehood ' play and shakespeare was a landslide . it was shockingly clear , '' said ryan l. boyd , a researcher at the university of texas at austin . the study , co-authored by boyd and ut colleague james w. pennebaker , was published in the journal psychological science . `` there 's very little wiggle room to interpret the numbers any differently . '' boyd said he and pennebaker analyzed 33 plays by shakespeare , nine by fletcher and 12 by theobald to create a `` psychological signature '' of each author based on word choices , phrase patterns and other factors . they compared those profiles to the language in `` double falsehood '' and determined that the play 's first half was almost entirely written by shakespeare , though the second half appeared to be split evenly between shakespeare and fletcher . only tiny traces of theobald 's signature were found . `` we 're certainly not suggesting that theobald did n't make edits , '' boyd told cnn . `` but he clearly did not write it . '' `` double falsehood , '' also known as `` the distressed lovers , '' is based on the `` cardenio '' section of don quixote , the classic 17th-century novel by miguel de cervantes . set in spain , the play revolves around the romantic entanglements of two brothers : one virtuous , one sinful . theobald said he based the play on three original manuscripts he had discovered , all of them written by shakespeare . but many scholars have long dismissed the play as a fake , suspecting that theobald tried to pass the bard 's work off as his own . shakespeare , who died in 1616 , wrote most of his published plays between 1590 and 1612 . british publishers arden shakespeare published `` double falsehood '' in 2010 -- for the first time in 250 years -- amid renewed claims by experts that it was shakespeare 's work . but the new study by boyd and pennebaker , the first to analyze the writings from a psychological perspective , may settle the matter once and for all . shakespearean scholar brean hammond , professor of modern english literature at nottingham university in the uk , praised the texas study for its scientific approach . hammond said boyd and pennebaker `` have got no dogs in the fight . they 're not literary scholars , -lrb- so -rrb- their work could be seen as more objective than some of the literary studies . '' hammond studied `` double falsehood 's '' authorship from a literary perspective five years ago and found shakespeare 's dna evident in the play . but he doubts the new research will put the matter entirely to rest . `` those people who do n't believe the play was written by shakespeare are n't going to just lay down and die , '' he said .",

'' yet , afalava has been denied the right to vote because the federal government insists that he is no citizen . how can it be , in the 21st century , that americans born on u.s. soil are denied the rights of citizenship ? that injustice clouds the recent celebration of the 115th anniversary of the decision of american samoa to join the united states . it is a wrong that afalava and other american samoans are now seeking to right in a federal lawsuit before the d.c. circuit . a decision could come any day . since the united states was established , it adhered to the rule that those born on u.s. lands were u.s. citizens . the rule is colorblind , yet the only exception that the supreme court has ever declared was not . the infamous dred scott case legitimized slavery as it declared that free african-americans had `` no rights that the white man was bound to respect . '' though they were americans , they were not citizens under the constitution . a civil war later , the 14th amendment reversed the ruling in the dred scott case . today , the dred scott case has come to be regarded as one of the worst decisions in the history of the supreme court . but racial discrimination did n't end there . in 1904 , a puerto rican woman named isabel gonzalez sailed for new york . because puerto rico was u.s. territory , she believed herself to be a u.s. citizen . but officials at ellis island labeled her an undesirable alien and prevented her from entering the mainland . she sued , with some reason to hope for a favorable ruling . yet the supreme court that eventually heard gonzalez 's case was still racist . in preceding years , for example , it had permitted a flat ban on naturalizing anyone of the chinese race . and , in a case addressing the status of recently acquired island territories such as puerto rico , the justices had cited the alleged racial inferiority of tropical peoples as reason to treat these lands as second-class u.s. territories . justice edward douglas white 's opinion stated that u.s. sovereignty extended over them , but that their residents did not hold the same constitutional rights as other americans . he did so , he privately revealed , because `` he was much preoccupied by the danger of racial and social questions . '' in the gonzalez case , the justices agreed unanimously that puerto ricans were not aliens and thus not subject to immigration laws . but they declined to decide whether or not gonzalez was a citizen . though preoccupied by fears that islanders were `` savages '' and racially unfit for citizenship , they were unwilling to violate the constitution . as a result of the court ruling , federal officials were able to deny gonzalez and others the full panoply of rights conferred on citizens for years . as isabel gonzalez 's lawyer told the court , declaring that residents of america 's island territories are not u.s. citizens would mean adding to `` precedents in our history of which we are least proud . '' those precedents , he warned the court , had been `` repudiated by the american people in the civil war , by three amendments to the constitution of the united states , by this court , and by ... advancing civilization . '' surely , 147 years after the dred scott case was overturned , the time has come to put an end to this farce . in the past century , the inhabitants of every other u.s. island territory have become citizens . today , emy afalava and his fellow american samoans are the last americans still waiting to become citizens .",

'' but it would be interesting to hear what any of the 2016 gop presidential candidates might have to say about `` gay emojis . '' and i would predict some conservative will claim that the kissing gay emojis will turn children gay . the fact is , when you embrace diversity , you will still leave out other minority groups . redheads , for example , are pretty pissed off because there are no emojis featuring their hair color . in fact , supporters of a redheaded emoji have started a petition that has already garnered several thousand signatures . even expanding the flags represented by emojis , as apple has done , comes at some peril . apparently canada is overjoyed that finally apple has included it . but armenians are not happy they were left out . i must admit that being partially of palestinian heritage , it 's heartening to see that despite the fact that some refuse to recognize a palestinian state , apple has chosen to now include a palestinian flag emoji . armenia , i feel your pain . of course the bigger question in the whole diverse-emoji issue is : what took apple so long ? how hard could it have been to add different skin colors to pick from ? that the company -lrb- finally -rrb- did is a step in the right direction : america 's demographics are changing , so our representations of who we are -- even representations as tiny as emojis -- should reflect this . apple has `` evolved '' in showing diversity -- from brown people to same-sex couples . maybe `` religious liberty '' conservatives who discriminate will follow .",

    "article": "london -lrb- cnn -rrb- the pentagon released a map this week showing coalition forces have taken back 25-30 % of iraqi territory seized by isis . the map , above , shows gains in key central and northern areas of iraq where the terror group was previously the dominant force . the gains made in the fight against the terror group by iraqi security forces and coalition air power certainly look impressive -- although as the u.s. department of defense acknowledges it 's a dynamic conflict and territory can change hands depending on `` daily fluctuations in the battle lines . '' so , how exactly should we read this information ? what does it say about the wider fight against isis ? cnn asked afzal ashraf , a counterinsurgency specialist and consulting fellow at the royal united services institute to give us a steer on what this new data tells us about the fight against isis in iraq . below is an edited version of the conversation . cnn : so , is the tide turning in iraq -- is the coalition winning ? afzal ashraf : when it comes to insurgencies it 's always problematic to think about the tide turning in terms of territorial gains because insurgencies by their very nature are extremely good at adapting to change . the one difference between isis and insurgencies in general is that isis declared itself a state , a caliphate once had territory so any loss is very strategic loss of prestige and image for them . -lrb- there have been -rrb- significant gains against isis -- particularly in tikrit -- and it 's no coincidence we 've seen isis make spectacular attacks in refugee centers in syria . it 's asymmetric warfare , they know they can not hold conventional force back for very long so what they do is they withdraw ... then take initiative elsewhere . they have to distract attention from those losses by gains and attacks elsewhere . it continues their image of initiative , of shocking , of reshaping the world -- which is what they are trying to do . cnn : what does the map tell us about the coalition 's strategy ? aa : it 's very telling . there are losses but most of the losses are around the edges of their territory and what that means is a very conventional push forward by the iraqi forces . it 's a push against the front line of isis rather than being brave and creative and going in behind isis 's lines and breaking it up . what this is n't is using maneuverist warfare -- which is a military philosophy that exploits the capabilities of conventional forces to project power by using air forces to take land along main supply routes and put friendly forces on that land to cut land into chunks which causes massive disruption to command and control and their supply chains which can cause forces to collapse much more rapidly than a frontal push . the capability you need -lrb- for this kind of warfare -rrb- is much more high-tech than the capabilities the iraqis have . those capabilities are available in the region -- jordanians , egyptians and other forces have helicopters and aircraft -- and it 's very interesting that the middle eastern nations have not developed an effective coalition to target isis which is an existential threat . cnn : what about ramadi ? isis seems to be winning there . aa : ramadi has been a potential battlefield for the past decade . but in this context -lrb- isis -rrb- will ... be pushing in ramadi because that 's an area they have lots of support . it also diverts their attention away from losses to their gains . the concept of success is hugely important to them -- it 's what sustains the recruitment effort of isis . nobody wants to join a bunch of losers , so it 's very important for them to be seen to be succeeding . above all this is a rhetorical war that is being fought deliberately in the media . they are losing so of course they are going to try to distract us by destroying ancient statues in nimrud and killing refugees in camps like yarmouk . but where it counts they are not standing and fighting .",

'' he concluded , `` we 're in unchartered territory here . '' mcgurk just returned from an urgent summit of coalition nations held in jordan . last week , canada became the latest nation to conduct airstrikes against isis over syria . the united states now lists 62 countries in the coalition . as the u.s.-led coalition has focused attention on iraq and syria , isis has expanded its reach to libya , egypt and yemen , often with existing extremist groups pledging allegiance to the militants . mcgurk did not rule out expanding u.s. military action beyond iraq and syria to combat the increasing regional threat . `` we have a lot of tools to protect ourselves and our national security interests , some of which are military tools , '' he said . `` of course we apply those tools when the president determines and our chain of command makes the recommendation that that is the right thing to do . '' the united states has also been stepping up efforts to involve sunni groups in the fight against isis . to date , that involvement has been extremely limited as sunni tribes see shiite militias , many with horrendous human rights records , take the lead . but mcgurk said that iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi is making progress getting sunni tribes to support a planned iraqi offensive against isis in anbar province in the coming weeks . he stressed the importance of working with al-abadi , noting that the iraqi leader was in anbar province last week handing out more than 1,000 ak-47s to tribal fighters who are going to join the iraqi security forces . `` we are helping to enable and train -lrb- them -rrb- as they begin to go on the offensive over the coming weeks and months in anbar , '' mcgurk said . `` they put out this very perverse , twisted vision , and it 's very attractive to a lot of young men around the world , '' he acknowledged . `` but in fact , what the foreign fighters are finding in syria and iraq is that they 're more likely to get killed in iraq and syria , and in fact , instead of getting a slave bride as isis leaders promise them , they 're more likely to get killed by a female peshmerga fighter in the streets of kobani . '' that bottom line , he assessed , could turn the tide : `` the foreign fighters are learning the reality of what it 's like when they go to join this twisted version of a caliphate , and i think we 're going to see those networks begin to dry up .

'' her persistence allowed her to capture intimate moments of cubans resting in the sweltering heat , crowding around a communal tv or just going about life despite their disintegrating surroundings . there are no modern appliances or conveniences in her photographs . the people in these solares are n't the fortunate cubans who have relatives visiting from miami with flat-screens and smartphones in tow . instead , there is the sense of time being whittled away -- one game of dominoes or one tv soap opera a time . sandretto said she hopes to continue to document the changes on the island that occur as the united states and cuba work to restore diplomatic relations and an inevitable influx of american visitors arrive . the thawing in relations could even change life in cuba 's solares . `` people want to travel , have access to the internet and improve their economic situation , '' she said . `` i hope that 's what happens .

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- as thousands of south africans took to the streets of the city of durban to rally against violence and xenophobia , an online community has joined the protests . the marches follow recent violent attacks on foreigners in the country that have claimed five lives . during the protest march thursday , twitter followers voiced their support through hashtag campaigns . #peacemarch and #saynotoxenophobia were some of the most popular . south african police services said more than 10,000 people attended the march , including civil rights groups and nongovernmental organizations . hashtags are now pouring out of south africa . but many are asking , some via twitter , is it enough to fight #xenophobia ? attacks this week in durban alone have killed two immigrants and three south africans , including a 14-year-old boy , authorities said . for south african tim flack , tweeting was n't going to make a bit of difference . flack , who lives in cape town , has brought allegations of hate speech and human rights violations against zulu king goodwill zwelithini , who he said referred to foreigners as `` lice '' and has said `` they should pack their bags and go . '' `` people listen to him , '' flack said . `` he is a monarch . the zulu people in south africa take him very seriously , they do n't question what he says . '' flack said he was motivated to make the allegations after seeing multiple complaints about xenophobic violence on social media and thinking they were n't enough . so he filed a complaint with the south african human rights commission , and then tweeted about it . `` the activists sit around feeling accomplished because they retweeted five times , '' flack said . `` i want to reach people who see that they can lay a charge and it wo n't cost them anything , but i will have done something to change the country and push it into a better state of being . '' now , the human rights commission must decide whether to investigate flack 's allegations against the king , who denies fueling any violence . flack hopes others will also make complaints . flack added that zulus are n't the only people in south africa who share in the xenophobic sentiment . `` people are frustrated and unemployed , and people in south africa pay foreign nationals a lot less , '' he said of the tension between nationals and immigrants . `` a domestic worker would ask for 250 rand a day to clean a house , whereas a foreign national would ask for 150 rand , so it causes resentment . '' imtiaz sooliman , founder and chairman of the gift of givers foundation in durban , does n't think most south africans are against foreigners . `` south africans are against xenophobia , '' said sooliman , who insists the majority of the country is providing an overwhelming amount of support for foreign nationals . gift of givers has been administering assistance at five refugee camps set up by the south african government that now hold roughly 8,000 foreign national refugees , he said , passing out things like clothing and hygiene packs . the organization posts its work at the camps online and tags it on social media with #xenophobia . why ? `` in south africa , everyone knows xenophobia , '' sooliman said , `` and the way a disaster agency works is we post what people understand . so if you say #tsunami or #war , people follow it . so here , people say #xenophobia , and they all know what it is -- it is a disaster , so you are going to post what people understand . '' he said south africans also have been going to the camps , which are on sports fields with makeshift tents , bringing cooked food and other necessities . `` this is different from what happened in 2008 , '' sooliman said . that year , scores were killed in attacks in the poorest areas of johannesburg . most of the victims were zimbabweans who had fled repression and dire economic circumstances . sooliman said that along with the government strongly condemning the violence , community engagement is happening now as it never happened before . it is a kind of national unity that can be best summed up with another hashtag that has emerged from this story : #weareafrica . only time , or , tweets will tell if it works .",

'' but rather than ignore it because it 's a glossy , blockbuster action film , some might argue that the movie goes against type for academy award nominated films because the cast is so diverse . `` furious 7 '' hits theaters friday , months after controversy was stirred about the lack of diversity at the oscars . there were no actors of color nominated and no women in the directing category , which was dominated by white males . mexican filmmaker alejandro gonzalez i\u00f1arritu went on to win best director for `` birdman . '' the lack of diversity was so glaring -lrb- even with the mostly black cast of the movie `` selma , '' which received a nomination for best picture -rrb- that it spurred the twitter hashtag '' #oscarssowhite . '' in contrast , `` furious 7 '' could n't be more racially and ethnically inclusive . the cast includes dwayne `` the rock '' johnson -- a samoan/black man -- black actors christopher `` ludacris '' bridges and tyrese gibson , hispanic performer michelle rodriguez , thai martial artist tony jaa , beninese expatriate djimon hounsou and the late paul walker , a blue-eyed , blond-haired california native . the filmmakers even went so far as to make sure casting directors in abu dhabi and dubai , where key scenes were filmed , found diverse extras . `` we were mainly looking for the diverse look of the -lrb- united arab emirates -rrb- , '' miranda davidson , owner of the casting company , told the national . `` they really wanted to make sure we reflected the international feel of the country . '' almost since the beginning , the `` fast and furious '' films have had a diverse focus and appeal . the band of street racers , which encompassed white , black , asian , hispanic , male and female and bond as a family , has done well at the box office with each iteration . in 2011 , then boston globe film critic wesley morris wrote , `` go on and laugh your benetton , kumbaya , kashi , quinoa laugh , but it 's true : the most progressive force in hollywood today is the ` fast and furious ' movies . '' `` they 're loud , ludicrous , and visually incoherent , '' he said . `` they 're also the last bunch of movies you 'd expect to see in the same sentence as ` incredibly important . ' but they are -- if only because they feature race as a fact of life as opposed to a social problem or an occasion for self-congratulation . -lrb- and this does n't even account for the gay tension between the male leads , and the occasional crypto-lesbian make-out . -rrb- '' according to the motion picture association of america 's 2014 theatrical market statistics report , while hispanics make up 17 % of the u.s. population they account for 25 % of frequent moviegoers . likewise , women make up 52 % of moviegoers . entertainment weekly points out that the film franchise is doing a much better job of reflecting its audience than others in hollywood . `` despite the films ' cumulative worldwide gross of almost $ 2.4 billion , their racial inclusiveness remains an outlier ; american movies are still overwhelmingly white , '' ew 's chris lee writes . `` according to ucla 's 2015 hollywood diversity report , a mere 16.7 % of 2013 films starred minorities in lead roles . '' at least one moviegoer tweeted that he appreciated the effort . diesel told ew the franchise has come a long way from the original 2001 film , which featured segregated gangs of racers pitted against each other . `` it does n't matter what nationality you are , '' the star said . `` as a member of the audience , you realize you can be a member of that ` family .

'' the actual number of children who were kidnapped and killed did not change -- it 's always been a relatively small number -- but awareness of the cases skyrocketed , experts said . but the news industry was expanding to cable television , and sweet images of children appeared along with destroyed parents begging for their safe return . the fear rising across the nation sparked awareness and prompted change from politicians and police . in 1984 , congress passed the missing children 's assistance act , which led to the creation of the national center for missing & exploited children . former president ronald reagan opened the center in a white house ceremony in 1984 . it soon began operating a 24-hour toll-free hot line on which callers could report information about missing boys and girls . joe sterling and cnn 's lorenzo ferrigno contributed to this report .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- the public outrage over the `` religious freedom '' bills recently passed in arkansas and indiana caught the governors of those states completely off-guard , judging by their confused and contradictory responses . as poll watchers , they surely knew that most americans now oppose the discriminatory laws and practices they accepted as normal only a dozen years ago . but the politicians underestimated the pushback organized by local and national businesses , including companies with no previous record of public support for social equality . they had better adjust to a new reality . for the past three decades , socially conservative evangelicals and pro-business interests have been powerfully allied against government regulations , environmental initiatives and social welfare programs , while supporting lower taxes for the wealthy and pushing back against the growing diversity in america 's population . for many , this alliance been puzzling : other , equally devout christians who place more emphasis on jesus christ 's message of unconditional love and on his denunciations of excessive wealth and neglect of the poor , have been uncomfortable with it , as have many business leaders . their priorities , after all , are based on the bottom line . and companies that sell goods and services to the public are learning that support for discrimination -- or even passive acceptance of it -- threatens that bottom line . hence , after indiana gov. mike pence signed a law that opened a new door for discrimination against same-sex couples , the threat of boycotts and other retaliation was swift , from groups as diverse as the national collegiate athletic association , the indiana pacers , walmart , eli lilly , apple and even the marriott international hotel chain . marriott international was founded by j.w. marriott , a dedicated mormon , and is now run by his son bill , also a mormon who fully accepts his church 's teachings about traditional marriage . yet in june , marriott international launched a '' #love travels '' marketing campaign , aimed at attracting lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender travelers with an assurance of `` the company 's commitment to make everyone feel comfortable about who they are . '' asked about the discrepancy between his religious rejection of same-sex marriage and his marketing overtures to same-sex honeymooners , marriott pointed to the bible 's injunction of unconditional love , but added `` beyond that , i am very careful about separating my personal faith and beliefs from how we run our business . '' in 2014 , global spending by lgbt travelers was estimated at more than $ 200 billion , and spending by this market segment is rising much faster than overall spending on travel . so marriott worries when states start to make such travelers feel unwelcome . businesses seeking to develop brand loyalty among younger consumers have a special incentive to highlight their rejection of anti-gay bias . a cnn poll taken in february found that 72 % of millennials nationwide believe that same-sex couples have the right to have their marriages recognized as valid . even among white evangelical protestants , 43 % of millennials support same-sex marriage , compared with less than 20 % of those their grandparents ' age , 68 and older . it used to be that businesses could close their eyes to discrimination in areas geographically isolated from the more liberal coasts , but that is no longer possible . according to researchers for mtv 's `` look different '' anti-bias campaign , 90 % of youths aged 14 to 24 agree that it is important to make their communities a less biased place , and almost 80 % say that everyone has a responsibility to help tackle bias . so who 's the `` moral majority '' now ? for media-savvy millennials , following that moral imperative means spreading the news about discrimination wherever it occurs and reaching beyond geographic boundaries to mobilize against it . in the first 24 hours after arkansas passed its version of the `` religious freedom '' bill , the twitter hashtag #boycottarkansas was used 12,000 times . it then snowballed after celebrity blogger perez hilton tweeted it to his 5.9 million twitter followers . america has crossed a threshold where it is no longer a good business model or political strategy to be intolerant of diversity , whether that pertains to race , ethnicity , gender or sexual orientation . since 2011 , the majority of children that have been born in the united states each year are members of racial or ethnic minorities . hispanics are projected to account for most of the growth in the labor force between now and 2060 . women now lead men in educational attainment . and more than half of americans live in states where same-sex marriage is legal . business leaders and politicians who ignore or offend these constituencies do so at their own peril .",

'' dumig met sahra through a photo workshop at refugio , a shelter in munich , germany , for refugees and torture victims . what drew dumig to sahra specifically was her strength and her ability to effectively reflect on all of her experiences . `` it really impressed me how she deals with everything , '' dumig said . `` she 's strong in her way of connecting with the culture here and also reflecting on what happened , the culture where she comes from . '' the number of refugees seeking asylum in the european union increased by 25 % last year , with germany receiving the most applications . one of the reasons dumig decided to photograph sahra is because growing up in germany made dumig realize that she lived a fortunate lifestyle . another reason has to do with dumig 's interest in people 's emotions and finding one 's identity . `` i realized so many people want to come to europe , and i always had the feeling to disappear or to go away , '' dumig said . `` seeing how people live in other parts of the world made me realize how privileged i am . '' `` apart together '' serves not only as a documentation of sahra , but as a far-reaching story about people from all backgrounds . the title of dumig 's work refers to the fact that although people may be physically apart from one another , the comparable feelings they experience are what link all people together . `` sometimes we feel strong , sometimes we feel lost -- that 's kind of universal , i think , '' dumig said . `` that 's why i want to universalize -lrb- sahra 's -rrb- story as well , not only make it about her . '' the underlying themes of `` apart together '' include the feelings of isolation and `` otherness '' and the search for a valuable human dignity . social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . `` every one of these -lrb- refugees -rrb- have strong stories , and in the bureaucratic system , they are just a number or a document , '' dumig said . `` but they are a person , they are people with emotions and lives . '' sahra is currently under the status of `` suspension of deportation , '' meaning german immigration officials may grant her discretionary relief from deportation . dumig describes sahra as someone living through an unresolved situation . regardless of the challenges sahra faces as a refugee in germany , she is a survivor and the embodiment of resilience , determined to establish a new life for herself . she has learned to speak german fluently , and she has started working in the nation as well . like an unsolved photographic puzzle , each photo within `` apart together '' provides a piece of insight into sahra 's experiences . there is no certain and clear way in which to arrange the pieces , because they are a representation of the fragmented nature of sahra 's life . many of dumig 's photos are not of sahra herself , but instead show her surroundings . this makes `` apart together '' rich in symbolism and challenges viewers to develop their own perceptions . the photos are powerful because of this symbolic nature , as there are infinite interpretations attached to each one . `` i think everyone interprets by themselves , by however way they perceive it through their own experience . that 's up to the viewer , '' dumig said . `` it depends on who looks at the pictures . ... everyone will see something different .

'' the dancer did not pursue a case against the bolshoi . when she left the bolshoi in 2013 , womack joined the kremlin ballet theatre where she still works , aged 20 , as a principal ballerina ; dancing close to the russian president 's office , next to the cathedrals inside the red walls of the kremlin . the surroundings may be opulent but her pay packet is not : for her role as a principal dancer womack says she is paid around $ 240 a month -- which works out at around $ 8 a day . the dancer says the amount of money she makes in dollars each month has fallen as the russian ruble has weakened -- the currency has suffered , in part , from a low oil price and international sanctions imposed on russia over its annexation of crimea last year . womack says a friend helps her with accommodation and she says she has to make the money stretch in order to buy food . `` for anyone paid a salary in rubles , especially since the crisis , it is extremely difficult . you have to decide what is worth more for you - experience or financial stability . i 'm at a point in my life where experience is worth more . '' sitting in the wings of the stage , chatting in russian to the other dancers and stretching before her rehearsal for swan lake , she says she has to make the $ 185 in her bank account last for the next few weeks . to earn extra money she dances bigger roles or takes part in events abroad . the kremlin ballet theatre says womack 's salary corresponds to her job title as a principal dancer and that , `` on average , the salary -lsb- principal -rsb- dancers are paid is significantly higher '' than $ 240 a month but that womack could have been paid that equivalent in dollars `` depending on the exchange rate on the day and depending on how much she danced in productions the previous month . '' as an american , womack says she is paid the same as her contemporaries and is treated just like the russians . but she says that is not always the case offstage . `` it 's extremely difficult to watch the deteriorating relationships between the united states and russia . the great thing about working for a russian company is that we are focused on creating art but ... outside the ballet world it is difficult for foreigners ; the general tendency tends to be more nationalistic and they unfortunately judge foreigners by their cover . '' although relations between the u.s. and russia have taken a nosedive since russia 's annexation of crimea last march , womack says she is `` very loyal '' to the kremlin ballet theatre . `` i love the russian system and i 'm very patriotic in that sense , '' she says . and despite the political situation -- and the money -- she says , `` russia has a lot to offer , it is a beautiful place that creates stars and that itself is worth investing one 's career in .",

'' this bolsters the association 's previous positions to oppose the use of the term `` drug '' for chemicals used in lethal injection and to oppose laws that require or prohibit pharmacists from participation in lethal injection cases . the group acted this week because of increased public attention on lethal injection , said michelle spinnler , spokeswoman for the american pharmacists association . that spotlight includes a january supreme court decision to stay the execution for three death row inmates in oklahoma . this was prompted by clayton lockett 's execution by lethal injection nearly one year ago in which he writhed on a gurney for 43 minutes before he died from a heart attack . in georgia last month , the execution of female death row inmate kelly renee gissendaner was postponed as a precaution when the execution team checked the medications and discovered they looked cloudy . thirty-two sates allow capital punishment , and lethal injection is still the most common method . last month , utah gov. gary r. herbert signed a law reinstating firing squads as a method of execution in cases in which lethal injection medications are not available . of the eight inmates currently on death row in utah , three opted for the new choice of death by firing squad . pentobarbital is the preferred drug used for lethal injection . in texas , the department of criminal justice told cnn in march they are running out of their supply . in july 2011 , lundbeck inc. , the manufacturer of pentobarbital , decided to no longer provide the drug to prisons for use in capital punishment . the companies that manufacture the products traditionally used in executions almost unilaterally decided to stop selling to institutions that used the products for that purpose , so states then turned to compounded preparations , spinnler said . `` pharmacists should not be involved in preparation of these products or involved in executions in any other way . '' she says . the new declaration by the american pharmacists association aligns with positions held by other professional medical organizations such as the american medical association , the american nurses association and the american board of anesthesiology .",

'' bentley began collecting them six years ago after a note caught her eye one rainy night on a walk in her home town of norwich , england . it 's something she confesses has been a lifelong love -- keepsakes ranging from her mother 's cutlery to her own dead goldfish have ended up carefully preserved in her collection for posterity . the notes project , she says , is a culmination of keeping her eyes on the sidewalk and spotting the little things that most people would n't notice as they walked down the street . `` i get very odd looks from strangers , '' she admits , `` but since i 've made friends and families aware of the project , they get very excited when i find one while out with them . '' and while some dismiss such behavior as hoarding , bentley feels it is part of human nature to hold on to items , no matter how small or insignificant they may seem . `` humans want to collect and show to others , '' she says . `` they want to share and learn from the things they have found . '' she says her collecting has led to interesting anthropological insights into the human condition . one of her favorite observations is the evolution of handwriting over the past few decades , from the beautiful copperplate penmanship of the '70s to modern teen girl love notes with hearts dotting i 's and multiple exclamation marks . more recently , the note collection has led to an exhibition at stour space gallery in london 's hackney wick , where bentley works as a shop and studio manager . it showcases a small part of her 1,500-strong collection . the decision to display the notes came in part from a desire to put them back into the public space . `` i always wanted to showcase them , to see what people 's reactions were and if anyone would come forward , '' she said . so far two note owners -- one a colleague from the gallery and one an employee from a pub whose beer coasters she had found on her quest -- have revealed themselves as owners of notes . bentley gave them framed prints as a thank you . and while some may find the notion of handwritten notes quaint , as social media and smartphones begin to replace handwriting , bentley says she finds the note collection an interesting way for an artist to explore people 's lives . `` technology is useful , but sometimes the simplest ways are still the best , '' she said . `` i still usually draw a map rather than relying on technology to get to a place -- and many people are just the same .

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- five years after the deepwater horizon rig exploded and unleashed the largest marine oil spill in the nation 's history , we are still experiencing -- yet only beginning to truly understand -- its profound environmental and economic repercussions . the immediate aftermath of the oil spill has been well documented , with declines in tourism and the seafood industry , as well as the significant destruction of wildlife in the region . since then , the amount of oil in the area has dissipated and communities have started to show signs of recovery . in fact , reports indicate that the gulf of mexico 's seafood industry , which supplies the united states with roughly 40 % of its seafood , is finally starting to rebound . however , profound challenges remain , in part because so many questions about the long-term consequences remain unanswered . to this day , it 's still unclear where all of the oil went , exactly how much remains or whether the reappearance of wildlife is a result of adaptation or a signal that the crisis is truly abating . one of the populations that can provide insight into these questions is the gulf crab . crabs play an important role in the region : roughly 60 million pounds were fished in the gulf in 2012 , earning tens of millions in revenue . yet in the aftermath of the spill , changes to crustacean communities in the area were quite apparent to the naked eye . researchers documented substantial differences in appearance , and deformities in crabs that were affected by the spill including lesions so numerous they ate through the joints , forcing limbs to fall off . these traits have affected not only the crabs ' market value but also likely their ability to survive . while these changes in outward appearance have dissipated in the short-term , the health of these crabs could still be precarious . i have been working with colleagues at florida international university and university of louisiana at lafayette to better understand what might be happening biologically inside the crab when it is exposed to oil and the dispersant used to respond to the spill . using the power of genomics and computational biology , we analyzed the genes of flat back mud crabs that were exposed to oil from the macondo prospect where the deepwater horizon rig was drilling when it exploded or to a combination of oil and dispersant in the lab . by studying gene expression , the process that turns information from a gene into a product that functions within a cell , we searched for indicators that might signal exposure to oil and , based on the types of changes we might see , clues as to how the crabs respond . although we are still in the early stages of our research , we are seeing significant differences in gene expression connected to exposure -- meaning the crabs are turning some genes on or off in response to oil and dispersant . we are still working to determine whether these changes impact their ability to survive and reproduce . it 's not just gulf crabs that are experiencing changes . research on different species and other aspects of the regional environment is starting to show that there could be long-term effects resulting from the oil spill and the response to the spill . this not only has consequences for the gulf area , where oil drilling continues , but also for communities along the atlantic coast , where the obama administration has recently announced a plan to open unprecedented oil and natural gas exploration . -lrb- bp 's vice president of communications , geoff morrell , told cnn that wildlife species in the gulf have `` bounced back and `` there is no data that suggests there are any long-term population-level impacts to any species . '' -rrb- . with the virtual certainty of more spills , we need a lot more information on the consequences of these disasters and how we can combat them effectively and efficiently . the u.s. department of the interior and the environmental protection agency are making some progress . in coming months , they are releasing changes to regulations and response plans based on the early lessons learned from the deepwater horizon spill . but government agencies can not just rely on the short-term data to determine the best response for the next oil spill crisis . instead , the government and oil companies should work together to support ongoing , long-term ecological research so that we have a better grasp of what `` normal '' looks like and what factors are important in maintaining those conditions even after a disastrous oil spill . only then will we truly understand the impact of offshore drilling and the best ways to respond to crises to protect our most important natural resources .",

'' farage -- who is on the campaign trail ahead of britain 's general elections on may 7 -- said he did not intend to cross swords with the prince . `` it is an impressive sword . i do n't have one but i 'm sure we could find one if we had to . but i 'm not intending to accept the offer , '' a spokesman quoted him as saying . `` i would have thought that a polish prince with a long polish lineage would rather agree with me that it 's a complete tragedy for poland that it 's lost so many of its brightest and best young people . '' ukip wants britain to leave the european union . it says it would not seek to remain a party to the region 's free trade or economic treaties `` while those treaties maintain a principle of free movement of labor , which prevents the uk managing its own borders . '' it has also pledged to cut the country 's # 9 billion -lrb- $ 12.4 b -rrb- annual foreign aid budget . another ukip politician appeared to back his party leader 's chances in a duel , tweeting an image of a medieval knight sliced in two , with the comment : `` this is what nigel would do to him . '' but there was no word on whether farage would even accept the prince 's less life-threatening back-up challenge . `` alternatively , if you do n't agree or if your sword is a little bit rusty , mr. farage , we can meet for a different kind of duel -- a duel with words in a tv studio in the run-up to the elections , '' zylinski suggested . `` i 'm up for it , it would be really nice , hopefully you will agree . '' zylinski posted a separate video on youtube entitled `` 7 reasons why the british should love the poles , '' in which he pointed to a times newspaper headline from march reading : `` we need more migrants ... they are the best workers in britain . '' the headline , he said , applied `` principally '' to the poles . `` what i can not accept is the amount of hostility and in some cases hatred towards the poles . enough is enough , i say , this has got to stop . '' zylinski pointed to polish contributions to britain including those made by polish raf pilots during the battle of britain , what he said was a `` wonderful work ethic '' and easy integration into the community . `` we are often more loyal to britain than many british people i know , '' he said . `` we are very grateful to be here . we would like you to be grateful too . please stop knocking the poles . we love this country we would like british to love us too .

'' after the story of the statue caught fire online this weekend , poulin publicly apologized monday for his `` most unsettling sculpture '' in a letter to the hollywood reporter . `` i take full responsibility for ` scary lucy , ' though by no means was that my intent or did i wish to disparage in any way the memories of the iconic lucy image , '' poulin wrote in the letter -lrb- pdf -rrb- . `` from the day of its installation , i have shared my disappointment in the final outcome and have always believed it to be by far my most unsettling sculpture , not befitting of lucy 's beauty or my ability as a sculptor .

'' thus began a bloody vicious cycle , with al-shabaab retaliating on kenyan soil with ever more spectacular mass killings . here are some of the most heinous attacks on kenya by the somali terrorist group . early thursday , while many students still slept , at least four gunman burst into a christian prayer service at garissa university college , leading into easter weekend . they shot students and took hostages , whom they herded across campus . as they encountered students , they separated them into muslims and christians . they spared the former , eyewitness joel ayora said . they killed the latter . kenyan special forces moved in at the campus located about 90 miles from somalia 's southern border . they killed four gunman , but not before 147 victims were shot dead . in december , al-shabaab militants carried out the same macabre division of captives by religion at a rock quarry not far from the somali border . they shot christian workers dead , and spared their muslim colleagues . red cross workers counted at least 36 bodies dumped into the quarry . it was eye-for-an-eye retaliation , the militants said , for raids kenyan security forces carried out on mosques intended to weed out extremists . parallel to operation linda nchi , kenya has gone after ethnic somalis within their own borders triggering protest by human rights watch , which has accused the government of ethnic profiling and mistreatment . in a 2011 case , kenyan authorities reportedly rounded up ethnic somalis in garissa and let them sit in the mud , while beating some of them , hrw alleged . passengers on a bus in kenya 's north were told to recite from the quran or die in november 2014 . shortly after the bus carrying some 60 people departed mandera , near somalia 's border , al-shabaab gunmen stopped it in a hilly area and barged in . those who failed to recite verses were gunned down , leaving 28 dead . in its claim of responsibility , al-shabaab said the dead were christians , and their killing was retaliation mosque raids by kenyans . a day after the attack , kenyan security forces retaliated with an offensive across the border into somalia . they claimed to kill 100 al-shabaab militants . in july , al-shabaab gunmen opened fire on the lamu coast , a popular tourist region , and at a police station in a neighboring county . they killed 22 people . last may , tour companies evacuated vacationers from kenya after the uk and united states issued alerts that there was a high threat of attacks . before the garissa massacre , the westgate mall attack was the deepest wound al-shabaab had inflicted on kenya . for four days , four attackers turned the luxury shopping mall in the capital nairobi into a cauldron of blood , smoke and rubble . part of the mall collapsed as kenyan security forces fought for control . at least 61 civilians were killed , as well as a handful of security officers . al-shabaab said the attack was retaliation for kenya participation in africa union military operations in somalia . even with al-shabaab 's shooting in garissa , al qaeda 's bombing of the u.s. embassy in 1998 remains the single bloodiest islamist terror attack on kenyan soil . in short succession , bombs detonated at u.s. embassies in kenya and tanzania back then . the nairobi bombing was much deadlier that the explosion at dar es salaam . al qaeda founding member mamdouh mahmud salim was arrested and accused in the bombing and is being held in a new york jail , where he still awaits trial . he is serving a 32 year sentence after being convicted of stabbing a prison guard there in the eye .",

'' key publicly apologized to bailey , a waitress at his local cafe , for repeatedly tugging on her ponytail , after she complained about his behavior in a blog post . the post , published on new zealand political website the daily blog , says that the odd behavior began during last year 's election season . it was `` hardly an acceptable form of greeting , '' bailey wrote . she wrote that while she did n't directly make her objections clear verbally , her body language `` screamed ' i do n't like that . ' '' `` as he approached me , he thought it would be fitting to raise his hands high and make scary , suspense sound effects , like the music from the movie ` jaws ' , '' read the post . `` as he towered overhead i slunk down , cringing , whilst -lrb- key 's wife -rrb- bronagh told him to ` leave the poor girl alone . ' '' the behavior carried on for a number of months and on several occasions , the post states . eventually the cafe 's manager made it clear to key that his actions were unwelcome . key , who regularly visits the auckland cafe with his wife , told reporters that his behavior was in the context of `` a bit of banter , '' but said that he had apologized when it was clear she had taken offense . the blog post says that the prime minister offered the offended waitress two bottles of his own jk 2012 pinot noir wine by way of apology . `` we have lots of fun and games there , there 's always lots of practical jokes and things . it 's a very warm and friendly relationship , '' he told reporters in los angeles en route to anzac day commemorations in gallipoli , turkey . `` but if you look at it now , no . when i realized she took offense by that i just sort of immediately went back , gave her some wine , apologized and said i was terribly sorry . '' politicians and public figures also rounded on key , with green mp metiria turei saying that the prime minister should be held to the same standards of behavior as the rest of the electorate . `` a lot of new zealanders know what it 's like to feel as if you 're not taken seriously in a job . as politicians , our job is to make people feel safe at work , not bullied , '' new zealand media reported her as saying . `` it 's a sign of how out of touch john key has become when he ca n't even monitor how inappropriate his personal behavior is , and when people are not comfortable with how he is behaving . '' jackie blue , head of the equal employment opportunities commission , echoed the sentiment . `` it 's never ok to touch someone without their permission , '' tvnz reported her as saying . `` there are no exceptions . '' political analyst bryce edwards told the network that the `` strangeness factor '' of the accusation would haunt key . `` a lot of people will be laughing at john key , that 's harder to recover from , '' he said in a segment . the national council of women of new zealand , while accepting that key was joking and did not mean to offend , criticized the premier . `` the fact that our prime minister has joined the list of people outed for sexism highlights how much sexism is a part of our culture . and it starts at the top , '' the organization 's chief executive sue mccabe wrote in an open letter . `` up and down this country , day after day , people are touched without giving their consent . at one end of the scale , it is an unwelcome pull on a ponytail . at the other end , it 's our shocking levels of violence against women .

'' an army air force veteran of world war ii , he studied architecture at the university of michigan and lawrence institute of technology near detroit , and worked for an architectural firm , but decided that drawing was n't the path to success . `` i wanted to build . '' in his autobiography , `` threshold resistance : the extraordinary career of a luxury retailing pioneer , '' taubman said that when he `` looked over the horizon , i saw that there was money to be made by people who could build and own stores or , better yet , groups of stores . '' he founded the taubman co. in 1950 and began to demonstrate what the company 's website calls an `` ability to assess and overcome threshold resistance -- a phrase he coined to describe the psychological and physical barriers that keep a shopper from entering a store . '' as the post-war growth of suburbia continued , retail developers like taubman began to consider what that might mean : more and more people needed places to shop . taubman embarked on multi-store developments in the 1950s , in places like flint and taylor , michigan , and in 1961 broke ground on his first large mall , the 350,000-square-foot arborland project in ann arbor . `` demographically , i looked at the numbers , and as far as i was concerned we could n't miss , '' he recalled in 2007 . `` and we did n't . '' indeed not . this year , forbes estimated his net worth at $ 3.1 billion , and the company 's u.s. malls generate average annual sales of $ 809 per square foot , according to the company 's website . but if alfred taubman gained fame and amassed billions as one of the people who helped define suburban life , he gained notoriety along the way , as well . in 1983 , he bought the renowned international auction house sotheby 's . and in 2002 he was jailed following a conviction for conspiring with rival auction house christie 's to fix auction house commission rates to maximize profits . he was released in 2003 after having served nine months in prison . he always maintained his innocence , saying one of his underlings had lied about him to keep from going to prison herself . taubman was renowned for his attention to detail , knowledge of design and for developing some of the best-known malls in the united states . he first project was a freestanding bridal shop in detroit . over more than six decades , his company operated nearly 20 properties in the continental u.s. , including well-known developments such as the beverly center in los angeles , the mall at short hills in new jersey and the shops at crystals , in las vegas . his designs evolved over the years to include not only enclosed malls but various styles of open-air developments . and his influence stretched far from the american soil and into the thriving markets of china and south korea . people we 've lost in 2015 . taubman remained active until the end of his life . he devoted much of his energy in his later years to philanthropic activities . and , just over three weeks before his death , he attended the grand opening of the mall of san juan in puerto rico with his sons robert and william . according to a statement by robert taubman , the patriarch had dinner in his home in bloomfield hills , michigan , on friday , then died of a heart attack . in addition to his sons , robert and william , he is survived by a daughter , gayle taubman kalisman , who is co-chair of the a. alfred taubman medical research institute 's advisory board , two stepchildren , and his second wife , judith mazor rounick , a former miss israel . cnn 's cameron tankersley contributed to this report .",

    "article": "seoul , south korea -lrb- cnn -rrb- on march 20 , 2013 , a cyberattack brought chaos to several banks and media outlets in south korea . then more ominously on december 23 last year , computers at the country 's nuclear operator were breached . again cybercrime was suspected . the source of these attacks ? north korea . and south korean investigators say they have proof -- the actual malicious codes used in the attacks . they shared this data with cnn . the 2013 attack , known as `` dark seoul , '' paralyzed an estimated 48,000 computers at a number of major banks and broadcasters , disrupting network systems and wiping their hard disks clean . `` it would try to delete essentially all your files ... then restart the system . you would come back up and nothing would be there , '' joshua james , a digital forensic expert , told cnn . `` if it infected more financial systems , it could have deleted all financial data in korea . i mean , it is dangerous , '' the visiting professor at chuncheon 's hallym university added . live footage of the breaches showed computer screens at the media companies completely down , while bank customers were unable to make withdrawals , or transfer money online . `` dark seoul '' happened shortly after the north korean government announced it would end the armistice agreement that brought the three-year korean war to an end in july 1953 amid growing tensions with its neighbor . the latest high-profile digital incursion , in december , attempted to steal data from south korea 's nuclear operator , including plant blueprints and personnel information . though investigators said no critical data was stolen , the attack raised serious concerns about the safety and security of the 23 nuclear power plants it runs . the attack itself was described by james as a `` spear-fishing '' exercise where unsuspecting victims -- retired and current employees of the nuclear operator -- were prompted to open up a disguised document in their email . `` as soon as you double click on it , it starts running in the background of your computer where you ca n't see ... it 's also trying to open up your computer -- what we call a back door -- to give access to the infected system by the attacker , '' he told cnn . the attack , which james said was simpler than `` dark seoul , '' came just a few days after sony pictures said their systems has been `` hacked , '' another attack the south korean authorities blamed on north korea . `` from a law enforcement or investigation side , we 're trying to actually trace back to who did it , '' said james . seoul announced in mid-march that some of the ip addresses used in december incursion could be traced back to shenyang , china , which can be easily accessed from the north korean border . codes used in the attack were said to be similar in pattern to those used by the north koreans , south korean authorities said . `` the malicious codes used in the attack were same in composition and working methods as `` kimsuky '' codes known to be used by north korea , '' the prosecutor 's office that leads 17 other government agencies and internet companies in the investigation said in the statement in march . pyongyang has dismissed the claims it launched these attacks , calling them a `` plot and fabrication that can never win over the truth . '' but many experts say north korea appears to be investing more in cyberwarfare because it is cheaper than spending on conventional weapons and can cause significant economic damage to its southern rival . indeed south korea 's defense ministry estimates that north korea is operating a `` cyberarmy '' of 6,000 workers as it focuses on strengthening its asymmetrical warfare capability . `` hacks are going on all the time , constantly -- though how many actually make the news is a very small amount , '' said james . `` how many are detected in general ? i think the average person would have no clue they 've been hacked . `` organizations need to invest the same amount that hackers are investing to protect themselves and right now they 're not , '' he added . many in south korea believe not enough effort is being put into defending against cyberattacks . a report by the korea institute for industrial economics and trade , a government-funded think tank , estimates that `` dark seoul '' caused about $ 820 million worth of damage . its report , published in 2014 , predicted that by 2020 , south korea could be exposed to hacking attacks causing up to $ 25 billion in economic damage .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- the world 's seventh-largest economy is heading toward collapse . an economic powerhouse conservatively valued at $ 24 trillion , one that annually churns out the equivalent of $ 2.5 trillion , is under assault . however , i am not referring to one of the g8 economies , but to the `` super economy '' of the ocean . it 's one that for far too long has been ignored and taken for granted -- and it is going downhill fast . the health and wealth of the ocean are assessed in a wwf report released thursday , reviving the ocean economy . the report is the result of a hard economic analysis performed by the boston consulting group built on a foundation of the latest ocean science provided by the global change institute of the university of queensland . true , the enormity of the ocean can complicate any single appraisal . but it is still important to try to understand its value if global leaders are ever going to sustain it for future generations . the fact is that the ocean feeds us , employs us , offers protection and plays a direct role in the lives and livelihoods of people throughout the world . the ocean also provides intangible but essential services to humanity , such as climate regulation and oxygen production , that are difficult to put in monetary terms . and while we all may look at the ocean from different perspectives , no one can escape the fact that it is a shared resource that provides for each and every one of us . a figure that may get lost in the headlines generated by our report is perhaps most telling : seventy percent of the ocean 's overall economic value relies on its continued health . ocean assets like fisheries , coral reefs , mangroves and seagrasses that produce goods and services rivaling the world 's top 10 economies will lose their value if we continue to over-exploit and outright destroy them . that may seem like a far-off possibility to some , but it is a future foretold by the many details in this report . for example , 90 percent of the world 's fish stocks are either fully exploited or over-exploited . and that is not all . by 2050 -- only a few decades from now -- it is possible that the ocean could lose its coral reefs , which have already been halved in the last few decades . this is n't just a concern for dive enthusiasts , but to the hundreds of millions of people that rely on ocean resources for their daily meals and their weekly paychecks . the ocean is truly too big to fail . the loss of the ocean 's critical habitats and species would have a devastating ripple effect on global food security and economies that no government bailout could salvage . fortunately , our report identifies actions that would revive the ocean economy , three of which are critical this year . first , the international community must rally around a set of sustainable development goals that clearly reflect the link between the environment -- including the ocean -- and human well-being . also , negotiators meeting in paris later this year must agree on an ambitious global climate deal that sets us on the path to avert the worst impacts of climate change . and finally , leaders must commit to conserving increasing amounts of coastal and marine areas over the course of the next 15 years . the economic case for why the ocean is so critical to livelihoods around the world is clear , and we will not be able to plead ignorance if we collectively preside over the collapse of the ocean economy . reviving the ocean economy is dedicated to helping us avoid that outcome , but it will require political vision and courage among policymakers . all this said , and as terrifying as it is that the deterioration of the ocean 's health has been its fastest in millions of years , there is actually some -lrb- potential -rrb- good news : if we act swiftly and with determination , marine resources can recover -- and recover quickly . many local examples -- from the mediterranean to the mozambique channel , from the fiji archipelago to the arctic -- show us that conservation , restoration and sustainable-use approaches mean the ocean , and the people who depend on it , can both prosper . ultimately , the ocean bridges continents , connects cultures and offers equal opportunity inspiration and we should therefore work together in support of this vital shared resource . but if we are to have any chance of avoiding the point of no return , we must find ways of reaching genuine global commitments on sustainable development and climate . after all , it 's far better to avoid an economic collapse than be forced to scramble to pick up the pieces .",

'' yet wednesday , the white house will celebrate earth day and promote its work to fend off climate change , while strategically ignoring its largest tool to cut carbon emissions -- nuclear energy -- as well as the warning of one of the administration 's favorite climate scientists . despite the fact that nuclear power is carbon-free , the obama administration 's energy policy plan is biased against it . this bias is created by how environmental protection agency credits nuclear power in its models of both current emissions and plan implementation . epa 's modeling is divorced from reality . first , epa 's `` base case for the proposed clean power plan '' purports to depict the current state of the industry as the future would unfold without the clean power plan . this base case assumes no new nuclear construction and indicates the retirement of 96 of our 99 operating nuclear plants by 2050 . epa 's implementation modeling , `` option 1 -- state , '' shows exactly the same situation : no new construction and 96 retirements by 2050 . in other words , epa assumes that the nuclear industry is essentially phased out by 2050 . these assumptions are tremendously important because they determine how emission targets are set and what state actions will receive credit toward those targets . a group of university of tennessee graduate students made this point to epa at a public hearing last summer . using epa 's own data , the graduate students showed that epa 's energy policy plan creates incentives for states to shut down nuclear power plants and replace them with natural gas combined cycle plants . the students demonstrated that under this scenario , epa 's model shows emission reductions while real world emissions actually increase . president obama 's epa has shifted its position on nuclear energy and hidden that policy shift in a model . for example , when epa modeled the lieberman-warner bill in 2008 , the agency indicated 44 nuclear plants would need to be built by 2030 in order to achieve the carbon reductions mandated in the bill . epa 's modeling of the 2009 waxman-markey bill showed the need to build 275 new nuclear plants by 2050 to meet the carbon reduction targets in the legislation . where did this policy shift come from ? at a recent hearing in the environment and public works committee , mary nichols , chairman of the california air resources board , told congress that epa looked at california 's california global warming solutions act when developing its so-called clean power plan and that epa 's plan adopts the same policy choices -- limited credit for either nuclear or hydropower -- both of which are carbon-free . thus , epa is assuming legislative powers and is making policy choices that favor some forms of carbon-free energy over others . congress did not give epa the authority to make these choices , so instead they have hidden them in the modeling . for example , the same modeling that assumes the nuclear energy phaseout coincidentally shows robust development of renewables without any retirements between now and 2050 . this is a very favorable assumption albeit unlikely considering wind turbines and solar panels are commonly believed to last only 20 to 30 years before needing replacement . this anti-nuclear bias also is evident in obama 's recent executive order `` planning for federal sustainability in the next decade , '' which directs agencies to reduce their carbon emissions . even though existing nuclear plants generate carbon-free electricity , the executive order does not allow agencies to take credit for emission reduction from nuclear energy unless it is energy from small modular reactors . while i have long fought back on attempts for the federal government to tax carbon , i believe in an all-of-the-above energy strategy that provides our nation with energy security , and i have supported legislation that helps to clean the air . the administration says it shares these same interests , despite differing avenues to get there . the administration also believes in man-driven global warming , which should make nuclear energy its golden key . but the clean power plan and the president 's recent executive order demonstrate that the obama administration is neither serious about reducing carbon emissions nor pursuing an all-of-the-above energy strategy . if you think this administration supports nuclear energy , think again .",

'' and , finally , `` lose some weight , baby girl . '' it 's pretty cringe-worthy stuff that seems difficult , if not impossible , to defend . mchenry quickly issued an apology , blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility . it was , however , too late : the #firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on twitter , where she was called everything from classist , class-less , and `` ugly on the inside '' to a `` sad , self-hating coward . '' espn , meanwhile , announced that mchenry would be suspended for a week . certainly mchenry should have known better than to have used such words , even if that 's what she was thinking , least of all because in our youtube age , such missteps always come to light . but while mchenry 's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement , evidence of a mean girl who never left high school , what 's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on mchenry without fully knowing -- or , it seems , caring about -- the other side of the story . the video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only mchenry 's responses , not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on . mchenry knew she was being taped ; at one point , she looks directly at the camera . the employee even threatens to make the video public . did mchenry keep going because she has that much of a self-destructive streak ? or because she truly could not help herself ? or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game ? how britt mchenry could have responded . these days , there 's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace , whether it 's lindsay lohan or brian williams or britt mchenry , who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing : that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial . the high price of public shaming online . sure , mchenry probably feels entitled , but that 's our doing , too . we 're a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal -- celebrating them , compensating them . and yet when , in a moment of frustration and stress , mchenry lets the entitlement bestowed on her win out over taking a deep breath and walking away , we 're right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve . you know what gives her the nerve ? we do . -lrb- be honest : when is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot ? -rrb- . but we 're really no better than she is . the problem with social media , and our dependence on it , is that it allows people to present and receive whatever angle they want , biased or not , fair or not . it 's the `` power of the press '' without the objectivity or accountability demanded of the actual press . and it has enabled a dangerous vigilantism that makes those who use that power no different from the ones they are supposedly rallying against . think about it . who was worse : mchenry or the people who made that video public , and who did so without owning up to their part in the conversation ? who is worse : britt mchenry for childishly mocking a confrontational tow employee 's bad teeth , or the twitter masses who call for justice and `` the return of class '' -- who express views like , `` part of me feels bad for britt mchenry . poor thing actually believes she was hired for ` brains ' and ` education ' ? should n't they question whether , in fact , mchenry could have actually been standing up for herself ? sorry to break it to you , but these days , we 're all bullies . at least britt mchenry owns up to it .",

'' granted , that 's not because republicans convinced the country that they were the party of women . but it is noteworthy that democrats who overtly pandered to women at the expense of real issues -lrb- and men -rrb- crashed and burned . to wit : . in colorado , sen. mark udall was nicknamed `` mark uterus '' for all the time he spent fear-mongering on women 's reproductive issues , only to end up , according to exit polls , eight points ahead among women . his opponent , cory gardner , finished 17 points ahead among men . in new york , a democratic candidate for congress , martha robertson , drew laughs from the audience during a debate for accusing her opponent of engaging in a `` war on women . '' to repeat , she was a woman , a democrat , in new york . in louisiana , sen. mary landrieu sought to give her ailing campaign a boost in by part blaming sexism for democrats ' lack of popularity in the south . not surprisingly , southerners voted for her opponent , bill cassidy . in texas , where liberal wendy davis ran almost entirely on an abortion-rights platform , she accused republicans of sexism for daring to scrutinize her inaccurate biography . her opponent , greg abbott , won by 20 points , and davis only ended up with 47 % of the women vote . whether in texas or colorado , new york or louisiana , voters made it clear they cared about more than just reproductive issues and were n't going to be bullied into voting democratic by false cries of sexism . but while democrats were screaming about the republicans ' `` war on women , '' few in the media acknowledged that the democrats ' deficit among men was actually greater than the republicans ' deficit among women . exit polls in 2014 showed that men voted for republicans over democrats by a 16-point margin , and women voted for democrats by only a four-point margin . regardless of whom republicans run for president , hillary clinton will most likely get the women vote . what she needs are men . so instead of running a woman-centered campaign , she might want to figure out a way to court the other sex .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- marco rubio is all in . the republican senator from florida has announced that he is seeking the republican presidential nomination , running on an optimistic message that he embodies the promise of the american dream . with his youthful energy and hispanic roots , it 's tempting to see rubio as the new blood that the gop needs in order to compete against hillary clinton in 2016 . yet rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues : immigration reform and cuba relations . he holds little appeal to latino voters . and unless he can offer new ideas , his climb to the republican nomination will be steep . back in 2013 , rubio was a member of the senate `` gang of 8 '' that crafted a bipartisan proposal for comprehensive reform , including a path to citizenship for the nation 's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants . he later distanced himself from the bill after it ran into resistance from house republicans , and now says he favors a piecemeal approach , starting with securing the border . his retreat on immigration means that rubio has missed an opportunity to set himself apart from most of the presumptive republican presidential candidates . that 's a shame , for this issue was supposed to be his calling card to latino voters . instead , rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration . he believes that president obama 's deferred action program , offering deportation relief to young immigrants , should be ended . he has stated that the president 's executive action on immigration , on hold pending a circuit court review , sets a `` horrifying precedent . '' meanwhile , both the deferred action program and president obama 's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by hispanics . no wonder the research firm latino decisions reports that , `` we find no evidence that rubio 's candidacy will draw significant latino support for his candidacy or for his party more generally . '' so , if rubio is counting on his ethnicity and personal history as the son of immigrants to win over fellow hispanics , he is mistaken . at a private breakfast monday for supporters , rubio described running against `` one candidate in the race who 's from yesterday , and one who wants to take us back to yesterday . '' but when it comes to cuba policy , rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past . over the weekend , he called the recent thaw in relations between the two countries ridiculous . he has warned that cuba is taking advantage of the united states . here , he is an increasingly lonely voice . most americans support better relations with cuba , as do a majority of cuban-americans . by clinging to the notion that isolating cuba is better than engaging with the communist country , rubio has marginalized himself on an issue where he could have provided insight and leadership . immigration and cuba policy aside , rubio 's political philosophy will be a tough sell to hispanics . he is a fierce opponent of `` obamacare '' and wants the law repealed . however , the affordable care act has led to a 12.3 % drop in the hispanic uninsured rate , making latinos the demographic with the largest gain in insurance , thanks to the law . -lrb- in fact , rubio signed his own family up for `` obamacare '' on the washington exchange , taking advantage of a generous federal subsidy offered to lawmakers . -rrb- . rubio favors smaller government , while latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less . and though rubio doubts that climate change is caused by humans , the new york times has noted that latinos view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue . sure , rubio is young and charismatic . but his work on the failed immigration bill notwithstanding , rubio has a significant lack of accomplishments to show for his five years in the senate . in february , he was reported as topping the list of absentee lawmakers by the website politico . another rubio weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals . consider that his fellow contender for the gop presidential nomination , sen. rand paul of kentucky , has been willing to present new ideas to the republican base , such as reforming the criminal justice system and legalizing medical marijuana . or that another gop candidate for president , sen. ted cruz of texas is entirely comfortable with his image as a conservative firebrand . by comparison , rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the task of rousing republican voters . with his early leap into the 2016 race , marco rubio is positioning himself as the next generation of gop leadership . unfortunately , a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination -- not for rubio , and not for latino voters .",

'' hillary clinton has leased her headquarters space in brooklyn and will soon make her presidential campaign official . and with the launch , jonathan martin of the new york times reports , will come a carefully orchestrated effort to reintroduce clinton -- with an emphasis on her childhood and her earlier work on children 's issues . `` the democrats around hillary clinton believe that while she 's one of the most famous people in the world , she 's never been properly introduced in her own right , '' said martin . `` so when she does roll out her campaign here in a couple of weeks , look for more biographical touches . we 'll hear about her childhood in suburban chicago and some of the work that she did as an advocate for the legal services corporation and the children 's defense fund when she was in her 30s , and also , more about her arkansas days as first lady , as an advocate for education . '' a lot of the big names signing on to team clinton are already known . but dan balz of the washington post explains part of the statement her campaign wants to make with the announcement is to show it has a large , experienced staff ready for the key national and state roles . `` what i 'm hearing is that when they launch , this staff is going to be even much , much bigger than we , at this point , imagine , that they have done a huge amount of hiring , '' said balz . and balz reports the planning centers on smaller events designed to highlight more personal interaction . `` she did an event with the wife of the mayor of new york earlier this week that could be a template for the kinds of things they 're doing . '' much of the media attention on the corruption indictment against democratic sen. robert menendez of new jersey has been on its allegations of luxury hotel stays with girlfriends . but beyond the more tabloidesque details , jackie kucinich of the daily beast notes that one of the charges centers on a suggestion the senator 's staff was soliciting funds for a so-called super pac -- a violation of campaign finance laws . and she says the scrutiny of that practice might grow because of the menendez allegations . `` i was talking to some campaign finance watchdogs this week and they say if the -lrb- federal election commission -rrb- really starts to look into this , they 're actually going to find some impropriety with other lawmakers much much farther than menendez , '' said kucinich . `` so watch for that if it starts happening . '' by a week from monday , there will be three official gop candidates for president : ted cruz , rand paul and marco rubio . others will soon follow , and as things get more official , pressure is mounting on gop operatives to choose sides . in new hampshire this past week , matt maroney , a former mitt romney alum with ground organizing experience , signed on with new jersey gov. chris christie 's team . others in the state reported calls coming in from ohio gov. john kasich and , yes , even donald trump . this dynamic plays out on the national level , too : republican pollster tony fabrizio , for example , was approached both by team christie and by allies of wisconsin gov. scott walker . in the end , though , fabrizio signed on with sen. rand paul of kentucky , who makes his official announcement on tuesday .",

'' her daughter asked during a recorded interview with egyptian television network cbc . `` your father died and i was six months pregnant with you . '' she replied . `` none of my siblings helped me . i raised you and sent you to school . without money i could not have gotten you an education . '' a widow at just 21 , dahou was forced to fend for herself in egypt 's patriarchal south , where decades ago it was unheard of for women to earn their own living . even in recent years , women make up barely 24 % of egypt 's workforce , according to the world bank . `` it is considered wrong that i dressed as a man but no one can judge . not you or anyone else . only god can judge me , '' dahou said , `` people talked but i said i decided to be a man so i can take care of my small daughter . '' the breadwinner worked as a brick maker for just 25 piasters , the equivalent of a few cents , until she saved up enough money to buy a shoeshine kit . she found a place for her wooden box , painted with red hearts and the egyptian flag , alongside the all-male shoe shiners of her community . `` if it was n't for my mother , i would have been on the streets '' houda , her daughter , told tv host mona al-shazly through tears . `` honestly i would have been in the streets . i did not find a home except with my mother . and even today my children rely on her . '' the years of sun and sand weathered and darkened dahou 's face and left her with a voice so deep and raspy she can easily be mistaken for a man . her only child , houda , eventually married and had two children of her own . through the years the one-time housewife dreamed of owning her own business one day , a small street stand to sell snacks and cigarettes . after her interview on cbc television , the governor of luxor province offered dahou a kiosk and a cash advance . the maverick had one requirement - she would only agree to meet with the governor in male attire . `` even if i die , i will not take it off , '' dahou said as she pulled on the male jalabiya in front of a tv camera , `` when i had to dress in a woman 's jalabiya when i went to cairo i felt suffocated . no , i thank god . i do n't want anyone to look at me or look at my daughter . '' now the 65-year-old who earned respect as a man has gained praise as a woman . egypt 's president , abdel fattah el-sisi , crowned her as one of egypt 's ideal mothers in an official ceremony last month . `` if i was really a man , i would not have done this , '' dahou told her daughter , `` i would have gotten remarried . i would have left you who knows where . you would have been treated without dignity or left homeless . thank god i was able to protect you .

'' opinion : alternative healing or quackery ? while many people believe the drugs are safe in large part because they are highly diluted , products such as cold-eeze , if taken according to the recommendations on the label , would be 10 times the recommended dietary allowance -lrb- rda -rrb- of zinc for adult females and eight times the recommendation for males , according to fugh-berman . too much zinc can have toxic effects . more than 130 people using another homeopathic medicine with zinc , zicam , reported to the fda that they lost their sense of smell . the fda issued a warning to consumers about it in 2009 . there is a misconception that all homeopathic products are `` natural '' according to the fda `` and therefore safe . unfortunately , fda has become aware of significant safety issues associated with homeopathic products in recent years , '' according to an email from the agency . other issues include a 2010 fda warning about hyland 's teething tablets . they also recalled the tablets that had inconsistent amounts of belladonna . larger doses of the substance can be toxic . in 2014 , the fda warned consumers about pleo homeopathic drug products having penicillin or derivatives of penicillin . another expert asking for stricter standards with homeopathic medicine , janine jagger with the familial mediterranean fever foundation , said that there should be stricter label standards that better explained what was actually in the homeopathic product . she believed there was a `` deceptive illusion of treatment '' when people chose these homeopathic options over pharmaceuticals that have been proven to work . a third of americans use alternative medicine . a mother and editor of an alternative medicine magazine and website , peggy o'mara , testified that homeopathic medicine has helped her family over the years . as a writer and editor of health publications , she said she has seen a growing interest in this kind of medicine , and she believes it is is well-placed . she believes people have more trust that consumers do their research before purchasing the product , as she does . she wishes doctors were better versed in this kind of medicine and believes others want `` safe , effective and easily accessible '' products that are `` nontoxic '' alternatives to help people feel better . the public hearing will continue tuesday . the fda could make decisions about these labeling and regulation standards some time this year .",

'' this curious paradox holds true today . our knowledge of the causes and dangers of climate change has increased even as our ignorance of its ramifications has unfolded . many of our elected representatives persist in inaction and complacency by arguing that individual nations are powerless to solve the problem because every nation is culpable . others choose to dispute the science , deny the evidence , and avoid the question of how to solve the problem . but climate change is only scary if we choose to sit , wait and do nothing about it . president kennedy encountered the same dilemma : `` it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer to rest , to wait . but ... this country of the united states was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them . '' we need not be frightened today . climate change is a chance for all of us to add a chapter to the story of american triumph and human progress . it is a moment for this generation to display the very qualities we attribute to the american political heroes of earlier times , who left the world a better place for us . courage of this scale will come from a people who are told that they can do great things by leaders who believe that their people are capable of great things . we believe that america will see opportunity in the danger of climate change just like we saw benefits on earth from travel in space . kennedy told the crowd at rice that the pursuit of a goal that seemed impossible was valuable precisely because it would be so hard to accomplish . `` we choose to go to the moon not because it is easy but because it is hard , '' he said . something so difficult would only be achieved through cooperation and national unity , and it would push us toward greatness . there will always be reasons for inaction . many will argue that responsible reforms will hurt our economy as it recovers from the great recession . they will exploit the fears of that time to justify extracting rents from industries and fuels whose days are numbered . progress on climate change will require courage . some leaders who stand up to meet the challenge may fall , but they can be sure that their sacrifice will light the world with more energy , more mobility and more freedom and ensure a healthier planet . we can start by making straightforward changes in the tax code that are acceptable to both the right and the left . by adopting policies that would make it in our trading partners ' interest to join us , meaningful reforms can provide solutions without making government any bigger . as americans , we are obligated to leave the world a better place than we found it . we believe , just as president kennedy did , that only if america leads on the most important issues of our time can we deliver on that promise . we call on our elected leaders to embrace the climate challenge before us and light a path to greatness once again .",

'' `` we are tremendously proud of him and the humanitarian work he did , '' the school said . at the time he was taken captive , lo porto worked with the german aid organization welthungerlife , a 53-year-old group dedicated to fighting hunger and poverty worldwide . such work means going to places where the need is most -- places like multan in pakistan . that community was one of many in pakistan devastated by major flooding in 2010 , which covered about one-fifth of the country and left more than 1,500 people dead . these conditions are all too common in the south asian nation , as evidenced by flooding one year later that forced upwards of 660,000 into refugee camps and killed more than 430 people , about a quarter of whom were children . `` he told me , ` i 'm pleased to have returned to asia and pakistan , i love the people , culture and food in this part of the world , ' '' said the london metropolitan university professor . specifically , lo porto was a project manager with welthungerlife 's clean water and sanitation program , working with 8 to 10 fellow international staffers and 100 to 200 locals starting in october 2011 , according to simone pott , a spokeswoman for the aid group . pott described lo porto as a lively , very positive man who made friends all over the world . some of those friends in italy , england and beyond pressed for lo porto 's release after he was taken captive , urging italy 's government and newspaper editors to get his story out , ansa reported . the same story said that al qaeda -lrb- after first claiming he was being held -rrb- denied abducting lo porto , as did the pakistani taliban . muehlenbeck , a german national , was freed last october , at which time he said that he and his colleague had been separated , according to ansa . but lo porto never got the chance to savor freedom again , like his german counterpart . italian foreign minister paolo gentiloni said his country 's government `` carried out every effort possible to trace and try to return giovanni to his loved ones . '' `` unfortunately , the conclusion is now different -lrb- than we wanted -rrb- because of the tragic and fatal mistake of our american allies , which has been recognized by president obama , '' gentiloni said . `` the responsibility of his death and -lrb- that -rrb- of warren weinstein ... is that of the terrorists .

'' in a landlocked country like nepal , where infrastructure is fragile to begin with , the consequences of such an earthquake had the potential to be `` much more serious , '' ravilious told cnn . those fears were realized when a magnitude-7 .8 earthquake centered less than 50 miles from the national capital of kathmandu rocked nepal , toppling homes , historic buildings and leaving more 1,400 dead , authorities said . `` this event , while large and tragic , is not unusual for that region of the world as the whole mountain range stretching from tibet almost to caspian sea is an area of major collision between continental plates , '' said geological engineer nicholas sitar with the university of california , berkeley 's department of civil and environmental engineering . what 's different this time from 1934 is the size and density of kathmandu , which suffered the brunt of damage in both earthquakes . `` the population has exploded in several decades , '' u.s. geological survey spokesman gavin hayes told cnn . `` when you get a vast population in the kind of building infrastructure that is n't equipped to handle shaking of an earthquake this size , that 's when you see the scale of disaster we 're seeing now . '' the big unknown is what happens next , now that the initial rumbles of the quake have passed , ravilious said . how will emergency response teams enter the landlocked country , whose single international airport is closed ? how will transports carrying aid move through the country if roads are destroyed ? if and when landslides start , how will mountainside villages in the himalayan range fare ? and , will it all be resolved before monsoon season starts ? `` the worry now is to get nepal up and running again on feet , '' ravilious said . `` the monsoons in a couple of months could make things worse if we do n't sort things out before then . '' an earthquake is the ground shaking caused by a sudden slip on a fault , according to the u.s. geological survey . stresses in the earth 's outer layer push the sides of the fault together , releasing energy in waves that travel through the earth 's crust and cause the shaking felt during an earthquake . nepal is located on a major plate boundary between india and eurasia , where collisions have been in progress for about 50 million years . those collisions are responsible for the construction of the himalayas , which has the tallest and some of the fastest growing mountains in the world , said chris goldfinger , director of oregon state university 's active tectonics and seafloor mapping laboratory . india is moving northward into eurasia at a rate of about 45 millimeters a year , with earthquakes of a magnitude from 8 to 9 occurring on average in the himalaya every 500 to 1,000 years , said marin k. clark , associate professor of geological sciences with the university of michigan 's department of earth and environmental sciences . the last major earthquake to affect this part of the himalayas was in the 1500s , and kathmandu was badly damaged in an earthquake that occurred farther east of saturday 's quake in 1934 . a major concern for this earthquake is damage from landslides generated by the strong shaking , clark said . the entire area that experienced shaking was in steep , mountainous topography where landsliding is a significant hazard . clark compared the circumstances to the 2008 earthquake in sichuan province , china . the magnitude-7 .9 earthquake generated more 200,000 landslides , many of which blocked roads , slowing response and recovery efforts . the landslides also blocked river valleys , which created significant flood hazard . `` we might anticipate a similar situation for nepal .

'' moment . research suggests that in trying to conjure up inspiration , most of us end up suppressing it . the book explains how to clear out mental junk , in order to make way for pivotal revelations . dr. kounios explained : `` insights involve unusual connections . cognitive psychologists call these ` remote associations ' . they are processed mostly in the brain 's right hemisphere . insights occur when a subconscious remote association suddenly pops into awareness . this is accompanied by a burst of activity in the brain 's right temporal lobe . '' `` we wrote `` the eureka factor '' to help people understand how creative insight works in the brain so they can use various strategies harmoniously without having them cross-circuit each other , '' said kounios . `` for example , there is evidence that imagining the future helps to put someone in an insightful state . however , if a person imagines a specific future that makes them anxious , then insightfulness could decrease because anxiety is a creativity killer . '' `` that said , a positive mood and a broad , expansive spread of attention are a couple of key features of the insightful state , '' he added . following are some of the tips they suggest for unleashing your creative potential -- both at home and at work . spaciousness helps broaden thoughts . even high ceilings have been shown to broaden attention . small , windowless offices , low ceilings and narrow corridors will do little to inspire our brains and make us flexible , creative thinkers . relaxing outdoor colors such as blue and green contribute to this state . `` emergency '' colors such as red suppress it . surprisingly , dark colors and dim lighting can also be beneficial : by obscuring visual details , they help people think more abstractly . static surroundings encourage static thinking . do n't be predictable . you should sometimes change everyday routines , such as where you go for coffee or your route to work . rearrange your furniture and decor from time to time , at home and in your workplace . hold meetings in a variety of places . make sure to include some nonconformists in your inner circle . unusual people tend to be out-of-the-box thinkers , and their unique outlook might help you attack a problem from a different angle . the threat of a firm deadline will narrow your thinking and inhibit your insight . try and use soft target dates and a flexible schedule to establish a helpful , nonthreatening time frame . rewards and punishments for meeting or missing deadlines , if needed at all , should be vague and mild so they do n't contribute added pressure . a positive outlook will help stimulate a more open mind , one that can process a greater number of ideas . if you struggle to think happy , try focusing on the people and things that bring you joy . to put a twist on pasteur 's famous saying , chance favors the happy mind . when you 're stuck on a problem , take a break to do or think about something very different . expose yourself to a variety of people and places . listen to music or go to a pleasing movie , art exhibit or talk a walk . play a game , dance , do yoga , read . insight triggers appear at the most unlikely times and places . we all know how important sleep is to our cognitive thinking . the sleep-deprived mind is more likely to fixate on small matters -- an absolute killer to creativity . ample sleep also helps foster the discovery of hidden connections between ideas . insightful thought is at its best when your powers of inhibition are weaker , because reduced focus opens up your awareness to remote associations that would n't come to you when you 're feeling sharp . if you 're an early bird , you should try doing your creative work at night . if you 're a night owl , try the morning . perhaps the single most important thing to remember is that your mental state can change . it takes a while to sink into an insightful mindset . try and schedule uninterrupted blocks of time for relaxed , freewheeling creative thought . turn off your phone . get rid of the clock . let abstract ideas and vague impressions flow where they will . tips have been extracted from the book `` the eureka factor '' , which has been written by dr. john kounios and dr. mark beeman . how missing sleep can damage your iq . how to make rejection work for you . 7 habits of highly ineffective people .",

'' unlike some critics , corliss appreciated all kinds of movies -- from the arty drama of ingmar bergman to the epic fantasy of `` the lord of the rings . '' his all-time top 100 movies list , which he compiled with fellow time critic richard schickel , contained everything from `` pulp fiction '' to `` finding nemo '' to jackie chan 's `` drunken master ii . '' `` he savored it all : the good , the bad , the indifferent . except that he was indifferent to nothing , '' zoglin wrote . `` to any fan or friend who would ask whether a new movie was ` worth seeing , ' corliss had a stock , succinct reply : ` everything is worth seeing . ' '' but corliss was not afraid to puncture hype around big movies he found overrated , including `` titanic '' -lrb- `` dead in the water '' -rrb- and even -- blasphemy ! -- `` star wars , '' about which he wrote , `` the movie 's ` legs ' will prove as vulnerable as c-3po 's . '' he also did n't care much for sentimental , uplifting movies that often become mainstream hits and win oscars . `` there are movies whose feel-good sentiments and slick craft annoy me so deeply that i know they will become box-office successes or top prizewinners , '' he once wrote . `` i call this internal mechanism my built-in hit detector . '' a graceful and prolific writer , corliss reviewed more than 1,000 movies , penned many time cover stories and authored four books on film , including `` mom in the movies : the iconic screen mothers you love -lrb- and a few you love to hate -rrb- , '' published just last year . -lrb- it was a partnership with turner classic movies , which , like cnn , is owned by turner broadcasting . -rrb- . some credit him with coining the phrase `` drop-dead gorgeous '' to describe actress michelle pfeiffer in a review of her 1985 film , `` into the night . '' he also cleverly , and subtly , gave away the big plot spoiler of `` the crying game '' by spelling it out with the first letters of each paragraph of his review . born in philadelphia , corliss moved to new york after college and began writing film reviews for a variety of publications before joining time in 1980 . he served as editor of film comment , the movie journal of the film society of lincoln center , for 20 years , was a frequent guest on charlie rose 's talk show and made annual pilgrimages to film festivals in cannes , toronto and venice . `` it 's painful to try to find words , since richard was such a master of them , '' time editor nancy gibbs wrote in a note friday to her staffers . `` they were his tools , his toys , to the point that it felt sometimes as though he had to write , like the rest of us breathe and eat and sleep . it 's not clear that richard ever slept , for the sheer expanse of his knowledge and writing defies the normal contours of professional life .

'' email your story ideas and tips to cnntips@cnn.com . full physical screening of employees also `` is incapable of determining a person 's motivations , attitudes and capabilities to cause harm , among other limitations . '' `` no single measure can provide broad-spectrum protection against risks or adversaries , '' the report said . `` therefore , risk-based , multi-layered security offers the greatest ability to mitigate risks through the application of flexible and unpredictable measures to protect commercial aviation . '' the tsa and most airports could not afford 100 % employee screening , the report said . only two major airports in the u.s. -- miami and orlando -- require employees to be screened through metal detectors , a cnn investigation found earlier this year . as a result of the report , tsa secretary jeh johnson announced immediate actions , including criminal background checks every two years for all airport aviation workers , screening of airline and airport employees traveling as passengers , reduction of access points to secure areas at all airports and increased random screening of aviation employees . johnson requested the tsa study after a delta air lines ramp worker and passenger at hartsfield-jackson atlanta international airport were arrested in december for allegedly smuggling guns onto flights to new york . since the incident , the airport has hired private security to check the bags of employees when they show up for work and has increased overall security . `` immediately following the incident in december 2014 , tsa increased the random and unpredictable screening of aviation workers at various airport access points to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities , '' johnson said in a statement . sen. charles schumer called johnson 's announcement `` a prompt response and a significant first step to closing the gaping loopholes in airport security , especially with regard to reducing access points and enhancing criminal background checks . '' specifically , the tsa report said employee vetting should be strengthened by `` updating the list of disqualifying criminal offenses , instituting continuous activity monitoring through the inclusion of additional federal bureau of investigation -lrb- fbi -rrb- and dhs data sources , and maintaining a national database of airport employees whose credentials have been revoked for cause . '' in addition , the tsa should expand the collection of domestic intelligence , which would include monitoring social media , and expand national reward programs to encourage employees to report security issues , the report said . `` although there is no perfect security system , the multiple layers -- which can be routinely enhanced or modified -- provide an effective means to secure passengers , employees and facilities , '' the report said . it also recommended increased surveillance of employees who work inside baggage rooms and cargo areas . cnn revealed this month that passengers filed 30,621 claims from 2010 to 2014 for valuables that were missing from luggage . the tsa report agreed with a 2008 homeland security study that found random screening was more cost-effective than mandatory airport employee screening . the committee that conducted the tsa study consisted of representatives from the tsa , airports , airlines , airline pilots , aviation security and law enforcement . rep. john katko , r-new york and chairman of the house homeland security subcommittee on transportation security , said , `` as threats to aviation security continue to evolve , it is critical that the transportation security administration , as well as the airport community , are adequately prepared to mitigate insider threats . i look forward to having a meaningful dialogue with airport stakeholders and the tsa on what can be done , going forward , to improve employee vetting and screening for those with access to sensitive and sterile parts of airports . '' rep. kathleen rice , d-new york , a ranking member of the transportation security committee , said the report makes it clear that the `` tsa must do more to neutralize the insider threat and prevent security breaches like we saw in december . '' `` screening every single employee may not be a cure-all solution , but every single employee should come to work every day with reason to expect that they 'll face random screening and inspections , '' she said . lauren stover , security director at miami international airport , told cnn , `` we support the findings of the committee and agree that there is no single solution in mitigating the insider threat , however we will continue our employee screening program as we believe that physical screening is a critical component to a layered security program .

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- is america a nation divided ? and has ohio found a better way to bridge those divisions ? it 's hard not to be concerned with these questions given the constant drumbeat of news about the issues that tear us apart as a nation : immigration , community and police relations , poverty , education and dozens of other crucial matters facing america . adding to our divisions is a harsh public atmosphere where politicians are preoccupied with how they can win the next election or give the best sound bite , and where lobby groups work to protect their narrow self-interests while ignoring a broader vision of what is best for our country . in ohio , we have been able to drive meaningful change on many thorny issues that have held our state back in the past -- social services , criminal justice , economic competiveness , infrastructure -- and i 've enjoyed sharing our state 's winning formula with others in my travels . in 2011 , i returned to public service -- after earlier serving for 18 years in congress in the 1980s and '90s . over the intervening years , ohio had lost its way and was hurting . i felt called to help after knowing that members of 350,000 ohio families had lost their jobs and were looking to get back on their feet . ohio is much stronger today . and that turnaround and success are worth being excited about and sharing . for example , we have gone from 89 cents in our rainy day fund and an $ 8 billion shortfall to now having one of the nation 's strongest state budgets and a nearly $ 2 billion surplus . we 've gone from losing 350,000 private-sector jobs to creating about 340,000 new ones . we 've gone from very high taxes across the board to the largest tax cuts in of any state in america , including tax cuts for the working poor . we 're seeing wages grow faster than the national average and ohio 's unemployment rate drop to the lowest level in more than a decade . getting ohio back on track was n't easy . it required big ideas , going against the status quo and tuning out those who worry only about protecting their own special interests . yes , we have a great success story to tell about our state . and we need to make ohio 's success contagious . the leadership style that helped us turn around ohio is needed in washington , where america 's $ 18 trillion debt ticks higher each day and our congressional leaders would struggle even to pass a resolution saluting mother 's day if it required their action . great leaders are not primarily guided by polls , political parties , focus groups , re-election , special interests or protecting the status quo . instead they bring teams of people together , challenge them to innovate and engage both sides to work together to fashion solutions based on common sense and the common good . as the chairman of the house budget committee in congress in the 1990s , i helped craft the first balanced budget since man walked on the moon . we worked in a bipartisan effort that does n't happen enough . there were , of course , disagreements along the way , but they never overshadowed the shared values we had to guide our work and the shared goal of fiscal responsibility and seeing our country live within its means . given the polarizing issues facing our country , america needs a leader who believes in a common set of fundamental values necessary to bring about change that will unite our country without being blinded by the many distractions that ego , selfishness and power produce . leaders who focus only on themselves and their own good have rejected this value-driven approach and make it impossible to make progress on our most pressing issues such as balanced budgets , tax cuts , welfare reform , border security , immigration and health care . we see it every day . there are certain values that guide great countries : . \u2022 personal responsibility : it obligates us to be accountable for ourselves so we can then do our duty for our families and our communities . \u2022 empathy : it allows us to walk in someone else 's shoes , so that in times of disagreement we might consider for a moment that there might be another , better way that makes all of us stronger . \u2022 teamwork : it sets ego aside and demands that we all pull in the same direction to win . \u2022 faith : it tells us we are made special in the image of god with unique gifts that enable our mission here on earth . these values allow us to develop policy solutions that solve problems in new and creative ways for the good of all americans instead of producing rhetoric , sound bites and press releases that too often pass for true reform . in ohio we 've implemented this winning strategy . it 's worked there , and it will work for the nation as well .",

'' `` i spoke to mr. sukumaran 's mother raji yesterday and assured her the government would continue to seek clemency from indonesian president widodo for both men . `` they have been rehabilitated in a most remarkable way over the past ten years and are genuinely remorseful for their serious crimes . `` nothing can be gained and much will be lost if these two young australians are executed . `` i again respectfully call on the president of indonesia to reconsider his refusal to grant clemency . it is not too late for a change of heart . '' the two australians , convicted for their role in a failed 2005 heroin smuggling plot , tried to challenge the president 's decision earlier this month but lost an appeal for the state administrative court to hear their case . their lawyers have since filed another review at the constitutional court . the attorney general 's office has said they would respect all ongoing court proceedings but insisted the inmates have exhausted all their legal options . australia has repeatedly appealed for clemency for the pair and has unsuccessfully proposed a prisoner swap with indonesia as a way of avoiding their deaths . on saturday , united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon called on indonesia 's government to reverse their decision . `` the secretary-general appeals to the government of indonesia to refrain from carrying out the execution , as announced , of 10 prisoners on death row for alleged drug-related crimes , '' a spokesman for ban said , according to various reports . meanwhile , human rights watch says president widodo `` has an important opportunity to signal indonesia 's rejection of the death penalty by sparing the lives of the 10 people facing looming execution . '' `` widodo can demonstrate true leadership by ending capital punishment as unacceptable state brutality , '' said phelim kine , deputy asia director at human rights watch , in a statement saturday . `` president widodo should recognize that the death penalty is not a crime deterrent but an unjustifiable and barbaric punishment . widodo should promote indonesia as a rights-respecting democracy by joining the countries that have abolished capital punishment .

'' it all highlights the more proactive role taken by india in recent months . just weeks ago , india flexed its military muscle to rescue indians and other nationals from conflict-torn yemen . now , it is taking the lead in nepal . some might say india 's friendship is a signal for the other big country that shares a border with nepal : china . a display of hard power , perhaps to achieve enduring soft power in the region . but in times like this , help is always welcome . first there 's the immediate search and rescue operation , and then the long process of rebuilding work . nepal will need india 's friendship -- as well as china 's -- for many long months ahead .",

'' he grows increasingly agitated , even as the line of questioning remains on-topic ; his attitude , meanwhile , grew increasingly smug . his eyes glaze over as the reporter talks , he makes condescending comments and gestures that seem intended to intimidate and imply he 's much smarter than guru-murthy , and he repeatedly looks toward his handler as if to say , `` do i really have to sit here with this guy ? '' at one point , he makes fun of guru-murthy for seeming nervous , saying , `` your foot is starting to jump a little bit . you better get to your next question . '' but it 's after guru-murthy asks downey whether he thinks he is `` free from all of that , '' referring to downey 's history of `` taking drugs , drinking '' that the building tension comes to a head . `` i 'm sorry , '' says downey , `` what are we doing ? '' to which guru-murthy replies , `` i 'm just asking questions , '' which indeed was so . downey has the right to refuse to answer the question , of course , but that 's not what he does next . instead , he throws the celebrity interview equivalent of a tantrum : he smiles arrogantly , says `` bye ! '' and stands up to leave . he sure showed him ! it 's true that we live in a culture where we feel we have the right to know everything about celebrities -- who they 're dating , what they 're eating , where they vacation , what they meant when they made that comment 10 years ago . journalists often go too far , even if it 's their job . and certainly not every journalist is good at his job . but while downey may be understandably tired of answering questions about his past , questions that have been asked before , his business is our business . the entertainment industry is about entertaining people . as such , we tend to like to watch actors who seem like they want to be watched . this is why most celebrities , especially those with a big budget movie to promote , agree to interviews and seek out recognition in general . but when the recognition no longer serves them ? then they want to bemoan it ? what downey seemed to misunderstand is that the interview format gives journalists the right to ask questions . that 's what an interview is . he certainly can decline to answer questions he does not feel are appropriate , or even ones he simply does n't feel like answering . but he does not have the right to be absolved for behavior that is rude , demeaning , and disrespectful -- even if he 's a celebrity , and even if he felt uncomfortable or put-off . what the video shows is a movie star with a bullying streak . after he removes his microphone and his handlers begin hustling him out with kid gloves , the actor can not resist a parting shot . he turns to the reporter , being sure to look directly at the camera on the way , and says , `` you seem okay . it 's just getting a little diane sawyer in here , '' followed by what sounds like , `` and you 're kind of a schmuck . '' downey might not have been `` in the mood '' to be questioned ... and those days , those moods , are understandable . we all have them . and yet in this case , that 's , well , too bad . the actor has agreed to an interview as part of his job . he has agreed to engage in a conversation with another professional human being . given the terms , he is not entitled to call all the shots . that he thinks he can is perhaps our own , celebrity-obsessed doing -- we revere the famous ; is it any surprise when they reveal that they , too , regard themselves as better than everyone else ? but it 's still on him .",

'' produced by sandler 's happy madison productions as part of a four-picture deal with netflix , `` the ridiculous six '' also stars will forte , taylor lautner , steve buscemi , john turturro , nick nolte , luke wilson and rob schneider , among others . the ictmn describes the movie as a western spoof on `` the magnificent seven , '' the 1960 classic about gunfighters who protect a village from a group of bandits . the movie was co-written by sandler and is being directed by his frequent collaborator frank coraci . actors playing historical figures include david spade as general custer , blake shelton as wyatt earp and vanilla ice as mark twain , according to the internet movie database . sandler had not commented publicly on the walkout as of friday morning , although people were criticizing him in comments posted on his facebook page . `` hey adam , act like an adult for once . respect others , especially native americans , '' wrote one commenter . in a statement sent to cnn and other media outlets , netflix defended the movie as satire : . `` the movie has ridiculous in the title for a reason : because it is ridiculous . it is a broad satire of western movies and the stereotypes they popularized , featuring a diverse cast that is not only part of -- but in on -- the joke .

'' `` i said ' i can help you make this fight happen , ' and he looked at me like , ` okay , i 'm listening . ' '' that 's when salvador told moonves his son trained at the hollywood gym owned by freddie roach , pacquiao 's trainer , and that he would put in a good word for moonves . at that point , salvador told cnn , he was driven more by his passion to see the fight happen than any real connection to roach . but he got roach 's phone number from his son , elijah , who was skeptical of his father 's plan . everybody had already tried , his son said . but salvador made the call and gained an audience in roach . `` i said , ` listen , i can help you make this fight happen , ' '' salvador said in an interview with cnn . salvador helped set up a meeting between moonves , roach and himself at scarpetta in beverly hills that he says began with a discussion about the legacy of boxing . `` mr. moonves said to me , ` if this fight happens , you 're going to be sitting there , ' '' said salvador . salvador 's role ended after that dinner . what followed was a series of meetings between moonves and both sides that eventually ended the stalemate keeping pacquiao and mayweather from entering the same ring . the may 2 fight -- on the pay-per-view services of showtime and hbo -- is expected to gross as much as $ 600 million . with that kind of money , and a smattering of media buzz around salvador 's story , inevitable questions circulated over what , if any , reward he should get , given the epic nature of the fight . when asked to comment , pacquiao 's team downplayed salvador 's role . `` for him giving les my phone number i do n't think he deserves a finder 's fee , '' roach told cnn . promoter bob arum said salvador `` got his 10 minutes of fame , '' though he called salvador `` a really nice guy . '' salvador insists he is not seeking money , and a cbs spokesman confirmed his role in the initial meeting . `` my reward will be sitting at the fight , '' salvador said . moonves made good on that promise -- salvador will be ringside on saturday night . `` it 's about taking a chance , '' salvador said . `` it 's about putting people in touch with each other and being able to sit back and say , ` wow , i planted that seed . ' ''",

'' tamara cotman , sharon davis-williams and michael pitts also were ordered thursday to serve seven years on probation , pay $ 10,000 fines and work 2,000 hours in community service . baxter had come under fire from some community leaders for giving prison sentences to eight teachers and administrators who stood trial and were convicted of racketeering . they 'd been accused of taking part in an effort to raise tests scores at struggling schools by erasing wrong answers and putting in correct answers . outside of court , benjamin davis , the lawyer for cotman , questioned the judge 's rationale in handing down heavy sentences a few weeks ago . `` i had never seen a judge conduct himself in that way , '' he said . `` what was going on with judge baxter ? '' davis-williams said she was pleased judge baxter changed his mind . her attorney , teresa mann , added , `` we are happy . we are elated that judge baxter took the opportunity to reflect . '' cotman , davis-williams and pitts , all school reform team executive directors , got the harshest sentences during an april 14 hearing : seven years in prison , 13 years of probation and $ 25,000 fines . baxter said of his change of mind : `` i 'm going to put myself out to pasture in the not-too-distant future and i want to be out in the pasture without any regrets . '' during the earlier sentencing hearing , baxter was frustrated when defendants did n't admit their guilt . `` everybody knew cheating was going on and your client promoted it , '' baxter said to an attorney representing davis-williams . at one point he said , `` these stories are incredible . these kids ca n't read . '' at a press conference held april 17 , most of the convicted educators insisted they were innocent . `` i did n't cheat . i 'm not a racketeer , '' said diane buckner-webb , a former elementary teacher . all defendants sentenced to prison have appealed and are out on bond . the lower prison sentences given to other defendants -- ranging from one to two years -- have not been reduced . prosecutors said the cheating is believed to date back to 2001 , when scores on statewide aptitude tests improved greatly , according to a 2013 indictment . the indictment also states that for at least four years , between 2005 and 2009 , test answers were altered , fabricated or falsely certified . michael bowers , a former georgia attorney general who investigated the cheating scandal , said in 2013 that there were `` cheating parties , '' erasures in and out of classrooms , and teachers were told to make changes to student answers on tests . bowers said he heard that educators cheated out of pride , to earn bonuses , to enhance their careers or to keep their jobs . of 35 atlanta educators indicted in 2013 , more than 20 took a plea deal . twelve educators went on trial six months ago , with 11 convicted and one acquitted on april 1 . of the 11 convicted , two took a deal in which they admitted guilt , waived their right to appeal and received much lighter sentences . one defendant was giving birth during the sentencing phase not been sentenced . on thursday , baxter urged the defendants to engage in community service while they 're appealing . he said that might lighten the punishment if the convictions are upheld . the judge said he was tired of dealing with the atlanta public schools cheating scandal , which he referred to as `` this mess . '' `` i 'm ready to move on . so , anyway , adios , '' baxter said , and ended the hearing .",

'' cnn spoke to several immigrants living and working in south africa about the crisis , which has caused south african president jacob zuma to postpone an overseas visit and left authorities scrambling to prevent further clashes . on tuesday the country 's defense minister said south africa would deploy troops to areas where police spread too thin in order to halt the attacks . zimbabwe immigrant stanley ndlovu says he is so frightened he dare not venture outside , not even to go to the local mall . he works in johannesburg as a cleaner and gardener , and also runs a small tuck shop where workers can buy food and basic supplies at his place of work . it 's a role he hears many south africans say should belong to them alone . he feels the south african government has been far too slow to respond to the violence , which has erupted intermittently in various cities over the past few years . `` to stop violence they need to arrest and sentence the perpetrators , '' he says . meanwhile , eric kalonji left the democratic republic of congo and arrived in the south african capital in 2012 , working as a waiter until the restaurant he worked at closed in january . now devoting himself to his studies in new zealand , he feels that the situation in south africa is more complex than a simple case of `` us versus them . '' he believes the blame lies heavily on what he calls the government 's failure to provide its people with jobs and education . `` this xenophobia thing is the result of a deeper malaise -lrb- in -rrb- south africans '' he says . `` a better policy from the government should be empowering the people with wider access to education so that they will qualify for the jobs that they say they deserve .

'' magazine and newspaper editors are well aware of the dramatic rise in sales when a royal baby hits the cover , especially a little girl . and then there 's disney , which will always appreciate princesses in the zeitgeist , but as with all things relating to the monarchy , there is also a far greater historical significance should a baby girl arrive . there have been 34 kings and only six queens over the course of the british monarchy 's thousand-year history , and yet some of the nation 's most enlightened times have occurred when a queen has been on the throne . elizabeth i led the country through the golden age , and victoria and elizabeth ii -- the two longest reigning monarchs -- both made their mark with perhaps the most illustrious and progressive legacies of all . while it is unlikely this child will ever be crowned , as the daughter of the second-in-line to the throne , her role will be significant . prince charles has made no secret of his desire to slim down the monarchy , but in looking at his family 's immediate bloodline -- william , harry and george -- it stands to be a heavily male-dominated one . in an institution viewed by some as archaic and out of touch , it is imperative to have a strong female presence . princess anne -- baby cambridge 's great-aunt -- grew up with three brothers , and was once described as , `` the greatest king the country never had . '' she is patron of more than 200 charitable organizations and carries out some 500 public engagements a year . a noted equestrian , she won two silver medals and a gold at the european eventing championships , and was the first member of the royal family to compete at the olympics . more importantly she has supported her mother throughout her reign , flown the flag for britain and promoted brand windsor around the world . as the only girl born to elizabeth and philip , she has matched and often surpassed the accomplishments of her brothers . princesses beatrice and eugenie , also true blood princesses , are not `` working members '' of the royal family and generally only roll out for state and ceremonial occasions . so , yes , it would be nice for the baby to be a girl so that we can all ooh and ah over frilly dresses , fairy wings and ballet shoes -lrb- although as a windsor she 's more likely to be mucking out stables and shooting pheasant -rrb- , but in truth the birth of a girl matters on a far deeper level : the monarchy needs a baby girl to fill the female void of future generations . the 20th century was ushered in by queen victoria and the 21st by queen elizabeth ii . should george live to eighty-seven he will be the first monarch of the 22nd century , but as i have said before the british monarchy is anything but predictable . if punters are right and william and kate do announce the birth of a baby girl as the rightful `` spare , '' it 's certainly possible that a seventh queen may ring in the year 2100 . in the event the couple welcomes a boy , however , i sincerely hope there wo n't be a collective groan of disappointment heard around the world -- after all on the few occasions we have seen prince george he has been a veritable treat . the birth of any baby is cause for celebration regardless of gender , race , religion or indeed status , and as prince harry , the world 's most eligible bachelor has shown , games of naked billiards can sell magazines too . read more : please do n't name the royal baby diana .",

'' they separated after going to therapy for about six months and jenner began taking female hormones and removing his hair through electrolysis . as he started developing breasts , his children began to notice -- a claim that jenner also made in his interview . thompson says jenner did not remain a presence in their lives after he married kris kardashian , mother of kim , khloe , khourtney and rob kardashian . together , the couple had two children , kendall and kylie . thompson said she forgives jenner for those years . he has already `` been held prisoner in his own flesh '' and hopes that his life will get easier now . in addition to `` world 's greatest athlete , '' she hopes people will remember him as `` trailblazer for the civil rights of the transgender community .

'' few details have been forthcoming so far from roscosmos . according to nasa , the cargo ship is carrying more than 3 tons of food , fuel , oxygen , spare parts and scientific experiment hardware for the space station . but the hitch will not put the six iss crew members at risk , nasa said . `` the spacecraft was not carrying any supplies critical for the united states operating segment -lrb- usos -rrb- of the station , '' a statement said . `` both the russian and usos segments of the station continue to operate normally and are adequately supplied well beyond the next planned resupply flight . '' that next flight , which will be the seventh spacex commercial resupply services mission to the space station , is not scheduled to take off before june 19 , nasa said . meanwhile , russian flight controllers continue their efforts to make contact with progress 59 as it passes over russian ground stations . nasa said tuesday that russian flight controllers had `` confirmed that the vehicle had entered into a slow spin and have issued commands to attempt to control it . '' according to russian state news agency tass , six attempts to make contact were to be made wednesday . the u.s. supplies on board the spacecraft include spare parts for the station 's environmental control and life support system , backup spacewalk hardware and crew clothing , `` all of which are replaceable , '' nasa said . u.s. astronaut terry virts , from maryland , is the current space station commander . cnn 's eliott c. mclaughlin , suzanne presto and amanda barnett contributed to this report .",

'' mocha likes to suck on fleece blankets and has been known to eat rubber ear buds or hair elastics , but nothing like a pile of jewelry , parkinson said . her breeder wondered if the dog was acting out of anxiety . that day , parkinson had left mocha in a different apartment the couple owns that the dog was n't as used to . the breeder told parkinson that dobermans are particularly known to get anxious and do these sort of things . `` she had a dog that actually consumed her whole dog bed , '' parkinson said . from now on , parkinson said she will put mocha in a crate if the dog will be staying somewhere new . follow-up x-rays monday on mocha showed a few pieces of metal left , `` but they were moving along '' and the vet expected her to pass them naturally . parkinson said friday mocha was `` her playful , energetic , curious doberman self . '' but now that she thinks of it , the timing of this whole incident is a little suspicious . `` my husband was all excited about the new apple watch , but could n't justify a reason to purchase it since he owned three watches , '' she said . `` i am convinced that he and mocha joined forces here to destroy all of his current watches in order to make room for apple 's new watch .

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- whether quaffing artisanal cocktails at hipster bars or knocking back no-name beers on the couch , more americans are drinking heavily -- and engaging in episodes of binge-drinking , concludes a major study of alcohol use . heavy drinking among americans rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012 , largely due to rising rates among women , according to the study by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington , published thursday in the american journal of public health . the centers for disease control and prevention defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day during the past month for women and two drinks per day for men . binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month . the increases are driven largely by women 's drinking habits as social norms change , researchers found . in santa clara county , calif. , for example , women 's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36 percent between 2002 and 2012 , compared with 23 percent among men . nationwide over the course of the decade , the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men . opinion : why are more women drinking ? `` it seems like women are trying to catch up to the men in binge drinking , '' said ali mokdad , a lead author of the study . `` it 's really , really scary . '' the study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level . in 2012 , 8 percent of americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers . despite the increases in heavy drinking , the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time , researchers found . madison county , idaho , reported the lowest rate of binge drinking in 2012 , at 6 percent , while menominee , wis. , had the highest rate , at 36 percent . hancock county , tenn. , had the fewest heavy drinkers -lrb- 2 percent of residents -rrb- and esmeralda county , nev. , recorded the most -lrb- 22 percent -rrb- . related : 1 in 5 high school girls binge drink . about 88,600 u.s. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010 , the researchers note , and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $ 220 billion per year . the increase in binge drinking does n't surprise terri fukagawa , clinical director of the new life recovery centers in san jose , calif. , where 15 of her 24 treatment beds are filled with clients primarily addicted to alcohol . she said she 's seen more people seeking treatment for alcoholism in the past four years . still , she noted , `` there are a lot of people still out there needing treatment , but they wo n't come in unless they have a consequence like losing a job or -lsb- getting -rsb- a dui . they think they have control over it . '' public health experts offer a number of cultural and economic explanations for the increase in excessive drinking . as a result of changed social norms , it 's now more acceptable for women to drink the way men traditionally have , said tom greenfield , scientific director at the alcohol research group at the oakland , calif.-based public health institute . young people are more likely to binge drink , and affluent people have the money to drink more . so the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like san francisco , san jose and oakland -- many in hard-working , hard-partying tech jobs -- may have helped spur significant spikes in drinking rates in the bay area and similar communities , experts said . taxes on alcohol have not risen along with the consumer price index , so wine , beer and liquor have gotten cheaper over time in real dollars , he said . alcohol advertising , particularly for hard liquor , has increased in recent years . a federal trade commission study found that companies spent about $ 3.45 billion to advertise alcoholic beverages in 2011 . alcohol control policies , such as limits on when and where alcohol can be sold and how long bars can stay open , have weakened in past decades , greenfield said . that may partly explain rising consumption nationwide , particularly in some states where `` blue laws '' once prohibited alcohol sales on sundays or in supermarkets . to conduct the study , researchers analyzed data on about 3.7 million americans aged 21 and older from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system , an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors conducted by the u.s. centers for disease control . kaiser health news -lrb- khn -rrb- is a nonprofit national health policy news service .",

'' many family members , across generations , live in the same house and will use the drugs together as `` a community activity , '' duwve said . and this has led to more needle sharing , which spreads infection . she said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade . another reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself . opana , as the prescription opioid is known , needs to be injected more than once a day . duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence . when people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours , they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal . often they 'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms . the other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood , which increases the risk of infection . health leaders worry about the spread of hiv and other diseases such as hepatitis c around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown . there has been a 150 % increase in hepatitis c between 2010 and 2013 , the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers , the cdc said . `` the situation in indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down , '' mermin said . `` this is a powerful reminder '' that hiv and other infectious diseases `` can gain ground at any time , unless you remain vigilant .

'' rosberg complained after the race that hamilton 's lackadaisical sunday driving was holding him up , pushing him back into vettel 's thrall and taking life out of his tyres . `` it 's interesting to hear from you lewis about your pace up front , '' rosberg said in the post-race media conference . `` that was compromising my race . driving slowly , that was unnecessary , and meant sebastian was closer to me . `` it cost me a lot of time ... i 'm unhappy about that of course . '' hamilton responded : `` it 's not my job to look after nico 's race . it 's my job to bring the car home . `` i did n't do anything intentionally to slow the cars down . if nico had wanted to get by he could have tried , but he did n't .

'' she 's also put off by the congested traffic and the high cost of parking . if shanghai 's extensive subway system does n't take her where she wants to go , she uses a popular uber-like taxi app -- or rents a car . she 's not alone . a recent report by consultants bain & company suggested that even though china 's love affair with the car began late , it may already be souring . of 2,137 people it surveyed , some 40 % said cars were losing their appeal as a status symbol . gu says luxury cars like bmws and mercedes are still an important way to `` show face '' among many of her friends . `` if you 've been working for 10 years and do n't have a car , people might wonder if you have financial problems , '' she said . but she prefers to spend her money on other things like traveling abroad . `` i do care about face but there are other ways to show it .

'' at that moment , the officer or deputy becomes an identifiable target whose whereabouts are available to any one of waze 's 50 million users worldwide . social media has made enormous contributions to law enforcement as a `` force multiplier '' that lets citizens help police protect our communities . as we have seen with the emergence of crimes like identity theft , however , technology has the potential for evil as well as good . in the case of waze , we are confronted with a tool that can be lethal to police officers and deputies , whose roles in society are to protect our citizens and enforce the laws that keep our communities safe . google , whose stated mission is `` to organize the world 's information and make it universally accessible and useful , '' is now marketing an app with the potential to obstruct law enforcement and put the lives of police officers and deputies at risk . even the more benign uses of waze 's `` traffic cop '' feature are concerning . in 2013 , 10,076 people were killed in alcohol-related automobile accidents . and in 2011 , 9,944 people lost their lives in speed-related fatal crashes . is the highest , best use of google 's geo-mapping and crowdsourcing capabilities to help drunk drivers avoid checkpoints and give speeders assistance in evading speed limits ? it 's not just the speeders and drunk drivers who have access to the locations of police officers through google 's technology . perpetrators of domestic violence can use it to find out about the presence of law enforcement in a spouse 's neighborhood ; gang members , narcotics dealers , even those intent on perpetrating an act of terror , all have access to waze 's `` traffic cop '' feature . google has built a solid reputation as a good corporate neighbor , tying for first place in a 2013 study by the reputation institute measuring companies ' reputations for corporate social responsibility . the company makes much of its compliance with legal , moral and ethical obligations as a good corporate neighbor . but when it comes to waze , google has gone into a defensive crouch . the company 's executives flat out refused to discuss the subject with representatives of the national sheriffs ' association , an organization representing more than 3,000 sheriff 's offices across the united states . the refusal of google 's executives to even dignify our concerns by meeting with us offends our conscience . if google 's real objective is the `` common good out there on the road , '' it will work with us to ensure the safety of both motorists and police officers . the goals are not mutually exclusive : we can have both .",

'' at the bottom of the list was jetblue , which offered the lowest percentage of award seats and the fewest number of award tickets of the five biggest u.s. airlines : 892,000 one-way passenger tickets , or 4.5 % of its total 19.7 million u.s. seats . -lrb- jetblue only operates in 10 of the top 25 markets included in the study . -rrb- . many jetblue customers fly the airline only once or twice per year , making it hard to accumulate miles , an airline spokesman told the magazine . by not allowing miles to expire anymore , the airline says customers will be able to eventually redeem them . delta air lines came in second place with 5.6 million u.s. award seats ; united airlines ranked third with 5 million u.s. award tickets ; and american airlines was fourth with 3.5 million u.s. award seats . what are the world 's safest airlines ? remember that award tickets are n't actually free . the cost of miles is built into everything you buy that 's earning you miles , and the airlines profit from you not using your miles at all . so it behooves consumers to book award travel carefully . on average , nearly 10 % of passengers on the five airlines analyzed by consumer reports flew on domestic award tickets , but some of them were n't getting the best value for their miles . while many u.s. fliers redeemed miles on american airlines flights from los angeles to san francisco , the cheapest average fare on that route was just over $ 100 -- not worth the 12,500 to 30,000 miles needed for an award ticket , consumer reports says . better to use them on american airlines ' route between new york and san francisco or delta 's route between chicago and los angeles , which are generally more expensive than that los angeles-san francisco route , according to consumer reports ' calculations . while award-seat availability is important , it may not matter as much as passengers ' overall satisfaction with an airline . southwest had the highest customer satisfaction score -lrb- 86 -rrb- , followed by jetblue -lrb- 85 -rrb- , delta -lrb- 70 -rrb- , american -lrb- 66 -rrb- and united -lrb- 63 -rrb- . and do n't forget the fees . southwest does n't charge any fees , while other airlines tack on fees for checking bags , booking by phone , changing plans and more .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- the best part of the supreme court oral arguments about marriage equality was when justice ruth bader ginsburg alluded to s&m . ok , she did n't actually mention s&m , but ginsburg talked about how the institution of marriage has already changed from long ago , when it was `` a dominant and a subordinate relationship . '' `` yes , it was marriage between a man and a woman , but the man decided where the couple would be domiciled , '' said ginsburg . `` it was her obligation to follow him . '' mary bonauto , the attorney arguing on behalf of the four same-sex couples who petitioned the supreme court , said in response : `` that 's correct . ... for centuries we had and europe had this coverture system where a woman 's legal identity was absorbed into that of her husband and men and women had different prescribed legal roles . and again , because of equality and changing social circumstances , all of those gender differences in the rights and responsibilities of the married pair have been eliminated . '' once upon a time , wives were the legal property of their husbands and `` marital rape '' was not only not a crime but not even a concept . to argue that the definition of marriage has not changed since then is either willfully ignorant or woefully na\u00efve . justice anthony kennedy , widely believed to be the key swing vote amidst a court otherwise generally evenly divided along ideological lines , at one point referred to `` the nobility and the sacredness of marriage . '' which is true , if you ignore the history of its past and the reality of infidelity in the present . if anything , the nobility and sacredness of marriage need protecting from straight people . one downside to arguing that marriage has `` always been '' between a man and a woman is that , therefore , any problems in the institution of marriage are also plainly the responsibility of heterosexual couples , too . the one justice who did n't ask a question is clarence thomas , who , with one slight exception , has now gone over nine years without a single inquiry from the bench . it should be carefully noted here that thomas is a black man married to a white woman . anti-miscegenation laws banning interracial marriage were first introduced in 1661 in maryland . that means that by 1967 , when the supreme court considered the constitutionality of such laws , bans against interracial marriage had been officially part of the american `` definition '' of marriage for over 300 years . just 20 years after the supreme court struck down the anti-miscegenation laws still in effect in 16 states , clarence thomas and his wife , virginia , were married . james braxton peterson , director of africana studies at lehigh university , has written , `` the fact that the thomas ' marriage required progressive supreme court action must in some way inform their sense of this moment . '' or maybe not . clarence thomas did n't say one way or the other , though his remarks outside court and in dissenting opinions suggest he 's firmly opposed to the supreme court doing for other loving relationships what it once did for his own . but perhaps the example of clarence thomas speaks to what seems most glaring about the oral arguments in the marriage equality cases , namely that just as with the rest of america , the supreme court seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics . perhaps this was always the case , justices hiding their personal beliefs behind legal rationales . still , the marriage equality arguments seemed even more shaped by politics than the law . on the one hand , pulling pages right from republican presidential candidates , conservative chief justice john roberts suggested the court should n't intervene in a state-driven social debate . aping conservative religious activists , justice samuel alito asked whether four people could then get married . on the other hand , justice stephen breyer talked about marriage as a fundamental liberty while justice elena kagan pushed back on whether legalizing same-sex marriage would really harm or take anything away from opposite-sex couples . both arguments , and the moral force beneath them , seemed to echo gay rights messaging . still , the highly political and momentous decision in loving vs. virginia was unanimous . whichever way the court rules on same-sex marriage , it appears unlikely the ruling will be unanimous . so , while the definition of marriage has unarguably evolved , a fact hopefully the supreme court will soon confirm with a ruling in favor of marriage equality , what 's also clear is that the court has evolved . blown by the winds of partisanship whipping up america in general , the supreme court is increasingly divorced from reason and submissive to politics . the question remains not what is fundamentally the right decision -- i think both law and morality are clear in favor of equal treatment . the question is simply which side of the court will dominate the other .",

'' this idea to create a fresh perspective drove him into the desert of western sahara , a long-disputed region of northwestern africa . thorpe uses the area 's harsh landscape as a powerful backdrop for soldiers posed as green plastic figurines -- similar to the popular toys that many children play with . the soldiers are with the polisario front , an independence movement that has been clashing with morocco over the region since the mid-1970s . thorpe said his project enables `` the creation of a visual metaphor from which a viewer develops their own emotional , physical and political response to war and conflict , when faced with the realization that the images do not contain toy soldiers but real soldiers . '' thorpe 's background was not in photojournalism , but in landscape photography , which lends to his powerful placement of the soldiers in the desert -- not to mention that all the locations chosen are historic locations of battles between morocco and the polisario front . `` the conflict in western sahara receives virtually zero coverage despite 2015 being the 40th anniversary of the outbreak of war there , '' thorpe said . after a ceasefire in 1991 , the people of western sahara have been living in a state of non-resolution . the people are split into two camps -- those living in moroccan-occupied territory , and those in refugee camps in algeria . social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . thorpe had to get clearance to work with the polisario front military and also had to be cautious of how many troops he moved about at one time -- otherwise he would have needed permission from the united nations . he usually worked with about 50 or 60 soldiers at a time . the autumn months did not offer much reprieve from the long hours in the sweltering desert sun . thorpe would work with the troops ' commander to position the men , then climb atop sandy mountains with his wide-angle lens and capture these striking images . they would work till dusk and then spend the night under the stars . not only were the soldiers willing participants for this project , but they also helped construct the platforms they stood on . thorpe said they were made out of old oil drums . after the elaborate five-week production , thorpe hopes his images will raise questions on `` how images of war -lrb- will -rrb- be consumed in the future with ever-diminishing attention spans and competition for them .

'' the actual number of children who were kidnapped and killed did not change -- it 's always been a relatively small number -- but awareness of the cases skyrocketed , experts said . but the news industry was expanding to cable television , and sweet images of children appeared along with distraught parents begging for their safe return . the fear rising across the nation sparked awareness and prompted change from politicians and police . in 1984 , congress passed the missing children 's assistance act , which led to the creation of the national center for missing & exploited children . president ronald reagan opened the center in a white house ceremony in 1984 . it soon began operating a 24-hour toll-free hot line on which callers could report information about missing boys and girls . cnn 's lorenzo ferrigno and joe sterling contributed to this report .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- would you want a tv program about your family history to include details of a distant , long-deceased relative who had owned slaves ? seriously , who in their right mind would want to be tarnished by the sins of an ancestor you had no connection to other than a remote bloodline ? i would n't , and neither did ben affleck , who lobbied producers of a pbs show , `` finding your roots , '' to remove any reference to his great-great-great grandfather benjamin cole , a georgia slave owner in the mid-1800 's , in an episode that looked at affleck 's family history . -lrb- affleck revealed cole 's name wednesday night . -rrb- . here 's the thing that might surprise many , given the tendency of the media to exploit any potentially scandalous material : the show 's producer , harvard professor henry louis gates jr. , apparently acquiesced to affleck 's request , because when the episode aired in october 2014 , there was no mention of the star 's slave-owning ancestor . affleck 's attempt to alter the content of the program only publicly became known a few days ago after wikileaks released hacked emails revealing an exchange between gates and sony pictures chief michael lynton . when gates asked how he should respond to affleck 's request to delete the material , lynton responded , `` all things being equal , i would definitely take it out . '' and on tuesday , affleck , via facebook , admitted that he had urged gates to excise any reference to his slave-owning relative . affleck explained , `` i did n't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves . i was embarrassed . the very thought left a bad taste in my mouth . '' now gates has publicly denied that he made his decision about the content of the program based on affleck 's request , but it seems likely that he did . after all , affleck noted as much in his facebook post , writing that gates `` agreed with me on the slave owner but made other choices i disagreed with . '' and three other celebrities profiled on the series last season were shown to have been related to slave owners . so it 's unlikely that it was simply happenstance that it left out any reference to affleck 's familial slave ownership connection . in any event , pbs has launched an internal review to determine if the show violated its own editorial standards . whatever the results of the review , affleck and gates did the right thing . let 's be clear : `` finding your roots '' is not an investigative news show ; it 's an entertainment program . in fact , as affleck noted , much of the material is provided directly by the celebrity being profiled . it 's not `` 60 minutes '' but more in the nature of a sophisticated profile of celebrities , using their marquee names to attract viewers . there 's not even a hint that affleck strong-armed the producers or made any type of threats against them if they included the information . in the emails between gates and lynton , which they presumably believed at the time were confidential and would remain so , there was no mention of undue pressure by affleck . instead , gates simply noted that affleck `` asked us to edit out something . '' after the emails were revealed , gates issued a statement , saying , `` ultimately , i maintain editorial control on all of my projects and , with my producers , decide what will make for the most compelling program . in the case of mr. affleck we focused on what we felt were the most interesting aspects of his ancestry -- including a revolutionary war ancestor , a third great-grandfather who was an occult enthusiast , and his mother who marched for civil rights during the freedom summer of 1964 . '' my view would be different if affleck had a history of uttering racist remarks or engaging in racist conduct . that would have made the information truly newsworthy . but instead we have a man known for championing progressive causes , which i 'm sure made him even more acutely sensitive that some on the right might possibly use this information against him in the future . perhaps that 's what affleck meant in his facebook post when he wrote that this information made him feel `` vulnerable . '' affleck has noted that he regrets asking pbs to not include information about his `` distant relative . '' that 's a nice gesture , but it was not needed . affleck had every right to ask for the information about a long-deceased distant relative to be left out of the show . and pbs had the choice to include it or leave it out . i applaud pbs for doing the right thing at a time when media outlets rarely show any restraint on the lives of people in the public eye .",

'' loeb says he met the actress in 2010 and they got engaged two years later , at which point they decided to create the embryos and conceive a child via a surrogate . after two attempts failed to bring fertilized embryos to term , they created two more embryos using her eggs and his sperm . `` when we create embryos for the purpose of life , should we not define them as life , rather than as property ? , '' he said . '' ... a woman is entitled to bring a pregnancy to term even if the man objects . should n't a man who is willing to take on all parental responsibilities be similarly entitled to bring his embryos to term even if the woman objects ? '' loeb said he filed a complaint against the 42-year-old actress to prevent her from destroying their two embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization . he filed it in august in santa monica , california , where they apparently lived while they dated . `` we signed a form stating that any embryos created through the process could be brought to term only with both parties ' consent . the form did not specify -- as california law requires -- what would happen if we separated , '' he said . '' i am asking to have it voided . '' representatives for vergara have declined to comment in the past . loeb has said he believes `` life begins at fertilization '' and wants to implant the embryos in a surrogate and bring them to term . he said he does n't want any money from the egg donor . the case has led to questions about who has the right to embryos . typically , a prior legal agreement between a couple spells out who has ultimate authority , said fertility specialist dr. david tourgeman , who 's not involved in this case . `` usually when embryos are created , whether the couple is married or just consenting adults , there 's usually a power of attorney that is described to these embryos , if they are frozen for future use , '' he said . in most cases , the mother or the origin of the egg is given power of attorney , although anyone can make a request , tourgeman said . if there 's a disagreement , the courts usually get involved to decide who legally owns the embryos , he said . vergara is now reportedly engaged to actor joe manganiello .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- would you build a house with water ? hungarian architect matyas gutai believes that water is the perfect material for keeping a house at a comfortable temperature . and while that does n't mean that he can do away with traditional materials like bricks , cement , and plaster , his system promotes a whole new idea of engineering . gutai built a prototype house in his hometown of kecskemet , south of budapest , with his high school friend milan berenyi , after years of research and development . the house was built with a grant from the eu , and showcases the `` liquid engineering '' concepts gutai has written about extensively . panels , some of steel , and some of glass , make up the structure of the house and a sheet of water is trapped between the inner layers , which equalizes the temperature across the building . the house is actually able to reheat itself , when its hot excess heat is stored either in the foundations of the building or in external storage , to be brought back to the walls when the temperature drops . the indoor temperature can also be modified using a monitoring system similar to central heating . this is a very efficient and sustainable system : the house can produce its own energy and be more independent of energy suppliers , which could reduce carbon emissions . `` our panel can heat and cool the building itself -- the water inside the panel does the very same job as heating , '' says gutai . `` it saves energy , when you compare it to a similar building with large glass surfaces -- it 's a very clean and sustainable solution . '' while studying sustainable architecture at the university of tokyo , in 2003 , gutai got the idea for his water house from a visit to the open air hot baths . despite the snowfall outside the pool , gutai remained comfortably warm inside it -- it was then he realized the importance of water 's surface temperature and its potential use in architecture . `` as an architect i think it 's really important that this building tries to redefine permanence , which has been a key concept in architecture for thousands of years . our approach to permanence has n't changed much at all , but now instead of making something very strong that tries to resist everything , we are making something that adapts to its environment . `` architecture is really changing in our time . we 've reached our limits when it comes to solid architecture , now it 's reasonable to look for a new system . '' `` this research dates back seven or eight years , '' explains gutai . `` i started it at the university of tokyo and it took us almost six years to get the building done . there are plenty of structural problems involved -- a lot of important questions were raised such as what happens if it 's so cold outside that the water freezes or what happens when one panel breaks . '' `` we now mix the water with natural solvents , that do not cause pollution but lower the freezing temperature to an acceptable level . this practically means , that even if the reheating technology fails , the water can not freeze . '' `` in case of cold climates , like in hungary , we also add some external insulation to the structure , to protect it from freezing . '' and if a panel were to break ? `` we designed special joint units . the joint elements allow slow flow , but block faster flows , '' he explains . this means that if one panel breaks , it will be sealed from the remaining ones instantly . this effect is based on fluid dynamics , and not computers or monitoring system -- which minimizes the chance of failure . gutai has worked in cooperation with universities and manufacturers to make sure the building is viable , and while the prototype house is only a small space -lrb- eight square meters in total -rrb- it demonstrates the power of this new technology . `` our goal should be to use less energy and materials , and take cities off-grid as much as possible . the water house is one way to do that , '' said gutai , who currently works as a researcher at feng chia university in taiwan . constructing houses in this way is moderately more expensive than traditional designs , but this prototype aims to slash our energy needs and gutai is working with factories and companies across europe on projects using this technology . to make water the building material of a greener future .",

'' oatway 's series of images of the ordeal landed on the front page of south africa 's sunday times under the headline , `` kill thy neighbor : alex attack brings home sa 's shame . '' it 's a shame that south africa continues to confront . seven people have been killed in the latest round of xenophobic violence against poorer immigrants , many from south africa 's neighbors . xenophobic attacks : how did we get here ? local media alleged that the attacks were a consequence of zulu king goodwill zwelithini reportedly saying at a recent gathering that foreigners `` should pack their bags and go '' because they are taking jobs from citizens . shortly after his reported comments , violence against immigrants erupted in the port city of durban . but on monday , zwelithini said he had not called for a war on immigrants . `` this war i am calling for today is to protect everyone of foreign origin in this country irrespective of which country they are from .

'' however , this number is not actually significantly larger than conventional open source estimates of 10 to 15 warheads previously provided by u.s. and other experts . the big takeaway from the report is instead the prediction that north korea could be in a position to double its arsenal by next year with weapons-grade uranium . if that assessment is correct , and pyongyang can indeed boost its nuclear stockpile by the end of this year to around 40 warheads by utilizing highly-enriched weapons-grade uranium , then the plutonium program that the u.s. and members of the six-party talks had been negotiating over this past quarter century would suddenly seem trivial . after all , the plutonium program might be capable of spitting out maybe a few weapons worth of plutonium annually . this news could be much more serious . why ? for a start , it would mean that north korea 's activities would undoubtedly meet the definition , if it had not already , of a runaway nuclear weapons program , with the potential to be fueled by a large supply of raw uranium buried in north korea 's mines . in addition , while the plutonium program at yongbyon has a clear and detectable profile , the thousands of centrifuges that spin in a uranium-based program have no detectable heat signature or topographic profile , meaning you could store the stuff not just in the labyrinth of underground tunnels in north korea , undetectable from the sky , but in any large warehouse . washington and seoul have tended to have a policy that leans toward downplaying north korean threats , at least when there is n't a full-fledged crisis going on . for example , the united states downplayed north korea 's missile threat until the country successfully put a satellite into orbit in december 2012 . and up until 2006 , no one thought the kim regime would actually dare undertake a nuclear test . these new estimates could therefore be a timely reminder that we may have downplayed the threat north korea poses once again . but thursday 's report is n't the only troubling information we have had recently . just as concerning is the norad commander 's assessment on north korea 's missile capabilities . on april 7 , adm. bill gortney said during a press briefing that the defense department believed pyongyang 's kn-08 intercontinental ballistic missile -lrb- icbm -rrb- is operational , with a warhead capacity . this statement is troubling for two reasons . first , gortney 's statement , when combined with the latest chinese assessment , implies that north korea now not only has nuclear weapons , but the ability to miniaturize such weapons for a warhead that could be placed atop a missile with range rings extending to the u.s. mainland . second , and just as importantly , pyongyang 's advances in mobile icbm capabilities could end up undermining the state of stable deterrence that currently exists on the korean peninsula . put simply , these capabilities could give north korea confidence that it is immune from any u.s. counterstrikes . and if that ends up being the case , the united states could find itself with a renewed headache in asia -- and its carefully calibrated plans for its pivot to the region crumbling .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- just before writing this column , i reached into the depths of my wallet , and in between the pilot licenses , i slid out a postage stamp-size certificate issued by the federal aviation administration . the certificate documents my successful completion of the dc special flight rules area , or sfra , online course . the online course verifies that i am knowledgeable to fly a plane under visual flight rules into the most highly restricted u.s. airspace in the country . although a `` no-fly zone '' over the white house has long existed , the sfra airspace was developed to protect the washington area further after the 9/11 terrorist attacks . the size of the sfra airspace is designed to be large enough to give our defense forces enough time to determine if a threat exists from an aircraft entering it , an opportunity to identify the threat , and if necessary , to divert or eliminate it . an airspeed restriction begins at a 60-mile radius from the center of reagan national airport . at the 30-mile radius , all aircraft must file a flight plan that identifies itself to air traffic control via a specific four-digit transponder code -lrb- a transponder is an electronic communication device that identifies a specific airplane on an air traffic controller 's display screen to indicate authorization for the flight -rrb- . aircraft must enter the sfra through specific flight `` gates '' that are displayed on a standard aviation map . aircraft on instrument flight rule flight plans , which include all airline operations , are not required to comply with sfra restrictions . air traffic control assumes the responsibility for the appropriate routing . as a matter of standard procedure , flights using an instrument flight rule flight plan have specific clearances with specific transponder codes , so the authorization for transit through the sfra airspace is already built into the system . why do i carry the certificate as an airline pilot ? i have had occasion to fly my own little airplane through the airspace on a visual flight rule flight plan . pilot who landed gyrocopter blogged about why . noncompliance with the airspace requirements , or worse , no communication at all , carries some serious federal penalties , which could include the suspension or revocation of your pilot license . being at the wrong end of an f-16 missile is also a possible penalty . so how does a flying machine that looks like a sophisticated lawn chair with helicopter blades invade such highly restricted airspace , as happened wednesday , when a postal carrier from florida landed a single-person aircraft on capitol grounds ? well , i 'm making an assumption based on the video footage , but it appears that this aircraft is classified by the faa as a gyrocopter . a gyrocopter can not quite launch straight up into the air in the manner of a typical helicopter ; it requires a short ground run for takeoff . and most gyrocopters are kit-built aircraft . it also appears that this particular gyrocopter may weigh just under 255 pounds , which classifies it as an ultralight aircraft in faa parlance . why is weight significant ? below that weight , a license for the pilot or a license for the aircraft is not required . in addition , to remain in the classification , the maximum designed airspeed ca n't exceed 55 knots . lawmaker looking into gyrocopter landing as pilot goes to court . a facility tracking the movement of this particular gyrocopter on radar would witness a speed probably attainable by the average canadian goose . and the radar reflection on a piece of machinery of that diminutive size is most likely very limited . if it was actually tracked on a radar screen , the target may have appeared to be a flock of birds . how much damage could this aircraft have inflicted had it been intended for nefarious purposes ? well , if it had been crashed into a building , i feel confident that the building would have been triumphant . if the intent had been to carry some sort of destructive device , the weapon would have had to be relatively small . the engine is not designed to carry more than one pilot . and lack of carry-on space is a definite issue . not that a review of airspace security measures is n't in order , but i would n't be concerned that this event will become the next threat epidemic . as an airline pilot , i can say i am relatively confident that our nation 's capital is secure from gyrocopter attacks orchestrated by misguided lunatics .",

'' the proposed training materials , overseen by appointed federal monitor peter zimroth , were submitted to manhattan federal court judge analisa torres on monday for approval . they include directives to `` not tell or tolerate ethnic , racial or sexist jokes '' and to `` not imitate the speech patterns '' of others . `` do not engage in racial profiling , '' the training materials read . `` it is against the law . it violates fundamental democratic precepts and freedoms . it violates this department 's policies . it is offensive . it violates your responsibility to treat people equally . it diverts us from catching real criminals . it alienates us from people who need us , and hurts our ability to do our job . you can probably think of other reasons not to do it , but the point is that you will not do it . '' the training notes also instruct new cadets `` not to use terms or words that devalue groups of people or stereotype them '' and `` not to imitate speech patterns of other racial , ethnic and class groups when communicating cross culturally '' because `` they appear disingenuous , artificial , and possibly racist . '' the revised training notes , which include 140 pages of instruction and powerpoint slides , are a result of a 2013 federal ruling declaring the new york police department 's `` stop , question and frisk '' practice unconstitutional . the nypd has said the policy -- in which police stop , question and frisk people they consider suspicious -- was used to deter crime . the practice had been widely criticized . police department figures showed that nearly nine out of 10 people `` stopped and frisked '' in 2011 were african-american or hispanic , though new york mayor bill de blasio has said 90 % of those stopped were innocent . `` the current training materials had not undergone a comprehensive review for some time ... -lsb- and -rsb- did not address some important subjects or account for some changes in nypd policies and law , '' zimroth wrote in a cover letter to torres . `` all parties agreed it was essential that the materials be rewritten for the current class to reflect current law and policy . '' the nypd collaborated with zimroth 's team in crafting the final training materials . they will now `` review their implementation in terms of our current and ongoing practices , '' said an nypd spokesperson in an email to cnn . the patrolmen 's benevolent association declined to comment . the materials also provide historical legal information on proper `` stops '' and offers detailed procedures for patrolling buildings for criminal activity . they also give instructions on how an officer should lawfully conduct him or herself when engaging with the public . `` remember that a courteous , professional and respectful police officer who illustrates the opposite of bias and discrimination helps create a partnership with the community and builds rapport with the people in it . `` the result is that the citizens become our allies and , in turn , policing becomes safer and easier . this enhances our effectiveness and increases our pride and pleasure in what we do , '' the notes read . if approved , the new training materials will be integrated into the class curriculum for the current class of cadets . they are expected to graduate in june .",

'' the country 's gearheads have embraced the suv or sport utility vehicle , sales of which jumped a third last year , and many will feature in the displays planned by dozens of european , japanese u.s. , south korea and chinese automakers . this year mg , once known for its sleek sports cars and now owned by shanghai automotive industries corp , enters the fray with its first suv , the gs , while ford will give two new luxury suvs their china market debut -- the lincoln mkx and lincoln navigator , the latter favored by hip hop stars . `` the suv is popular as a first car , '' said raymond tsang , a shanghai-based partner at consultancy bain & company . `` if you only have one , you want one that you can commute in and take on a road trip . '' foreign brands have dominated sales in the past two years , but as they improve product quality and design , local rivals like geely , which also owns sweden 's volvo , and great wall motor are clawing back market share , especially when it comes to suvs . geely , which already exports to russia , the middle east and africa , is also stepping up its efforts to crack more developed markets . it is preparing to export the volvo s60 inscription to the united states from a factory in the southwestern city of chengdu . it would be the first car made in china to hit u.s showrooms and may pave the way for chinese brands to shake up the u.s. market like japanese and korean car manufacturers did decades earlier . with car ownership still at much lower levels than the u.s. and europe , china is likely to remain the industry 's most important market for decades . however , the breakneck growth may be a thing of the past . in 2014 , growth in sales halved to 7 % and according to the china association of automobile manufacturers , the slowdown continued in the first three months of this year when sales rose just 3.9 % . it comes as the wider economy slows and a prolonged campaign against corruption has hit sales of luxury vehicles , especially brands like audi that have been the ride of choice for chinese officials . on top of that , the hassles of car ownership are deterring some potential buyers , as is an awareness of the environmental costs . congested and chaotic roads , restrictions on the number of new vehicle license plates and a shortage of residential parking space may trigger a backlash against car ownership , according to a recent report from bain & company . `` the car was seen as a status symbol , '' says pierre-henri boutot , a partner at bain and co-author of the report . `` but now in larger cities they see the hassle and some of these people are thinking of giving up their car . '' just maybe , china will need those car babes to boost sales after all .",

    "article": "bangkok -lrb- cnn -rrb- thailand has lifted martial law , replacing it with it a controversial new security order granting sweeping powers to the ruling military junta . critics have expressed alarm at the move , with human rights watch 's asia director brad adams saying it marked the country 's `` deepening descent into dictatorship . '' martial law was lifted wednesday when the thai king bhumibol adulyadej approved a request from prime minister general prayuth chan-ocha to proceed . prayuth -- head of the national council for peace and order -lrb- ncpo -rrb- junta -- immediately invoked article 44 of the country 's interim constitution `` to curb acts deemed harmful to national peace and stability . '' article 44 states , in wide-ranging terms , that when the head of the junta believes it is necessary in the name of public harmony or to prevent the undermining of national security , then he has the power to act as deemed necessary . according to a statement issued by the ncpo , the new order grants military personnel powers to issue summons and arrest those who commit crimes against the royal family or against national stability , who commit crimes involving war weaponry , or who violate the orders of the ncpo . designated military personnel were granted powers to seize assets , to block media from reporting or publishing , and to detain suspects up to seven days , the statement said . unauthorized political gatherings of more than five people were banned , while those who defied ncpo orders could be imprisoned for up to a year , it said . those who were detained could not leave the country without the approval of the head of the ncpo . human rights watch said in a statement that the new security order would allow prayuth `` to issue orders without administrative , legislative , or judicial oversight or accountability . '' `` thailand 's friends abroad should not be fooled by this obvious sleight of hand by the junta leader to replace martial law with a constitutional provision that effectively provides unlimited and unaccountable powers , '' adams said in a statement . sunai phasuk , human rights watch 's senior researcher on thailand , told cnn the move would see prayuth `` become a strongman with ultimate power in his hands to wield as he wishes . '' `` this is a dangerous indication that the junta is not going to keep its promise to restore democracy and respect for human rights in thailand , '' he said . rupert abbott , deputy director for asia pacific at amnesty international , called in a statement for the ncpo to `` reinstate the rule of law and constitutional protections for human rights which the 2014 coup steamrolled over . '' meanwhile , the united nations high commissioner for human rights zeid ra'ad al hussein expressed alarm at the news . `` normally i would warmly welcome the lifting of martial law -- and indeed strongly advocated for it to be lifted in thailand , '' the high commissioner said . `` but i am alarmed at the decision to replace martial law with something even more draconian , which bestows unlimited powers on the current prime minister without any judicial oversight at all . this clearly leaves the door wide open to serious violations of fundamental human rights . '' martial law was imposed shortly before thailand 's military seized power last may , ousting the democratically-elected government of yingluck shinawatra after months of sometimes violent street protests . since then , the ncpo has curbed civil liberties , muzzled the media and rounded up opponents . amnesty international says that since may , hundreds of people have been arbitrarily held and dozens brought before military courts for engaging in peaceful political gatherings or expression . thai political scholar and coup opponent pavin chachavalpongpun told cnn that the move from martial law to the new security order amounted to `` pouring the same wine into a new bottle . '' `` the junta is trying to reinvent itself , but the substance is still there , '' he said . `` in a word : it 's absurd . everyone knows in thailand they had to abolish the martial law because of international pressure . `` but article 44 is a lot worse than the martial law because it gives total power to the ncpo . '' thailand 's military rulers have insisted that such restrictive measures are needed to maintain stability , following a decade of political conflict which has pitted a royalist , middle-class bangkok elite against shinawatra 's supporters , mostly drawn from the urban working class or the rural north . but pavin did not believe there was a sufficient threat to national security to justify the new order . `` the notion of national security has been exploited over and over , '' he said . a spokesperson for the u.s. embassy in bangkok said it was important that thai citizens were allowed `` to freely exercise their fundamental rights , including the rights of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly .

'' the deaths are the latest illustration of the increasing flow of migrants from north africa and the middle east through the mediterranean and into europe -- assuming they survive the trip . gemma parkin , a spokeswoman for save the children , said that the number of migrants who have fled to find refuge in europe has skyrocketed 70 % this year over last , a dramatic rise that she attributed mostly to the deteriorating security situation in libya . about 8 % of the recorded migrants between january and april 19 of this year are children , parkin said . of those , 70 % are n't unaccompanied by adults -- some of them as young as 9 years old . such numbers represent only people rescued at sea or caught once they reach land . frontex , the european union 's border management agency , says that many illegal immigrants get through without being detected ; moreover , most of them come in legally via airports and then overstay their visas . cnn 's nick paton walsh reported from tripoli and cnn 's steve almasy and greg botelho wrote in atlanta . cnn 's ingrid formanek in catania , italy , contributed to this report .",

'' `` we are waiting for him . we 're very happy he is coming , '' said ulises , a man who sells brightly colored paintings of antique cars to tourists on the street next to the sprawling havana cathedral . `` he should come and get to know it and walk around the pretty spots in havana . '' cuba 's state-run television reported that francis would visit , but like the vatican did not report exactly when he would arrive . francis , the first pope from latin america , played a role in restarting diplomatic relations between cuba and the united states , earning praise from both u.s. president barack obama and cuban president raul castro . the pope made personal pleas to obama and cuban leaders in private letters , writing that the two nations should try to reset their relations after decades of friction . the vatican also hosted talks between u.s. and cuban delegations in october , where they hashed out aspects of a new trade policy and discussed the release of jailed american contractor alan gross , who was freed as part of the detente between the two countries . `` i want to thank his holiness , pope francis , whose moral example shows us the importance of pursuing the world as it should be , rather than simply settling for the world as it is , '' obama said in december as he announced a u.s. policy shift on cuba . since his election in 2013 , pope francis has displayed a deep interest in international affairs . he repeatedly urged western leaders not to bomb syria , hosted a prayer service between israeli and palestinian leaders at the vatican and waded into diplomatic controversy last week by referring to the killing of 1.5 million armenians a century ago as a `` genocide . '' the latter move deeply upset turkish leaders , who recalled their vatican ambassador . the pope is expected to continue his international activism in july with a trip to south america , where he will visit ecuador , bolivia and paraguay . in late september , francis will visit washington , where he will address congress ; new york , where he will address the u.n. general assembly ; and philadelphia , where he will celebrate a public mass that 's expected to draw more than 1 million people . francis will be the third consecutive leader of the roman catholic church to visit cuba . st. john paul ii stopped there for several days in 1998 , and pope benedict xvi visited for three days in 2012 . church officials in havana said that they expect francis ' visit to be shorter than those of his predecessors . officials from the vatican are expected to travel to the island soon to finalize logistics for francis ' trip , the officials said . cnn 's patrick oppmann reported from havana . cnn 's jason hanna wrote in atlanta . cnn 's hada messia contributed to this report from rome .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's easy to be anxious about the threat posed by the islamic state of iraq and syria . after all , this is a brutal organization that not only kills but seems to revel in doing so in ways designed to shock the world -- from the beheadings of journalists to burning a jordanian pilot alive . such moves are part of this murky group 's propaganda and its deliberate efforts to manipulate information . so what can and should we make of the organization ? i explore the issue in depth in a special airing sunday night . and although it 's important to start with the caveat that isis is indeed trying to scare and confuse us , i took away some tentative lessons from speaking with the people who have traveled inside the minds of isis . first , isis is clearly about religion -- its version of radical islam -- but it is also about power . there is increasing evidence that the military backbone of isis is made up not by a group of islamic zealots , but rather high-ranking officers from saddam hussein 's army -- baathists who were at least ostensibly secular . an internal isis report detailing its organizational structure was reported on last week in the german weekly der spiegel . that report describes a group that uses its religious ideology as a recruiting and governing philosophy , much like communism . but underneath it , much like communism , is simply a drive for control , a lust for power . next , isis presents itself as a global organization , but it has thrived because of a local cause . the group has gained territory , cash and recruits primarily because of the rage and rebellion of the sunnis of iraq and syria , who believe they must fight the shiites to secure their own survival and strength . the reality is that that sunni cause is going to endure for some time . the united states has been successful in its tactical battles against isis and has managed to push the group back from many of its gains in iraq . but the sunnis of the region will remain in rebellion and the sunni-dominated areas will remain in turmoil -- chaos that isis will be able to capitalize on this chaos . in the long run , isis might very well find that its greatest foes lie within its so-called caliphate . the few reports that are emerging from areas controlled by isis suggest that , unsurprisingly , people do not like living under a brutal , theocratic dictatorship . they live in fear , and even those who chose it as an alternative to shiite rule are growing disenchanted . in this respect , isis is like other radical islamic groups , such as the taliban -- they have an allure in the abstract , but once they are actually governing in their medieval , barbarous manner , the allure fades and the disenchantment builds . the result is ever-increasing repression . remember , no one has ever voted isis into power anywhere . the group simply slaughters its way to control . of course , one of the big questions has been : is isis a threat to the west ? the group 's leaders declare that it is . but their ambitions appear to be mostly centered on their arab enemies , on building a caliphate in iraq and syria . they understand , of course , that to be terror group no. 1 , they must battle the country that is the world 's no. 1 power -- the united states . with that in mind , they seek such a confrontation and hope that the united states will come to the middle east and fight them on their terms , on their terrain . still , while they are opportunists , and they ask and hope that their followers act in america , their main focus is not to come here -- they want americans to go there . yet no matter how one rates the level of the threat isis poses , the group has changed the nature of terror . the leaders of isis have recognized that above all , they are a messaging machine , which in turn becomes a recruitment machine . this means that the key is not what happens on the ground , but on the airwaves and in the bits and bytes of the internet . and isis does this better than anyone before them because while their gruesome videos would seem a repulsive turn-off -- and are to most -- they still work on the web . the shock and awe they produce makes them go viral , and thus are seen by tens of millions . that ensures that these videos attract those utterly alienated young men -- a few thousand among the world 's 1.6 billion muslims -- who seek revenge , glory and gore . unfortunately , as long as those young muslim men , scattered across the globe , are attracted to isis and stream to its cause , the group presents the world with a danger that is impossible to fully assess but is one that grows by the month .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- the justices of the supreme court practice politics as much as law -- and that will be clearer than ever when the issue of same-sex marriage comes before the court on tuesday . public opinion on same-sex marriage has turned upside down since the supreme judicial court in massachusetts first legalized the practice in 2003 . overwhelming opposition has turned into substantial majority support , especially among young people of all political persuasions . even the name of the issue has changed -- to marriage equality . of course , the constitution has not changed since 2003 , a point that will surely be made by such opponents of same-sex marriage as justice antonin scalia . to originalists like scalia -- those who believe the constitution should be interpreted only as it was originally understood by the framers -- the idea of a constitutional right to same-sex marriage is anathema . to them , the constitution means only what it meant to those who wrote it -- and james madison -lrb- or the authors of the 14th amendment , just after the civil war -rrb- never gave a thought to whether they were granting gay people the right to marry . but the supreme court has always been about a lot more than the intentions of the framers . and public opinion is just one of the extrajudicial factors that the justices sometimes take into consideration . in 1954 , the supreme court ruled unanimously that public schools could no longer segregate students by race , even though the authors of the 14th amendment clearly considered segregated schools to be permissible . chief justice earl warren , who wrote the opinion in brown v. board of education , recognized that the world had changed , especially in light of the cold war . warren knew that segregated schools damaged the united states ' reputation in the contest for hearts and minds around the world , and he steered the court accordingly . warren 's motives had nothing to do with the framers ' intentions , and little to do with the words of the constitution itself , but these kinds of motivations have been common throughout the history of the supreme court . there are risks , of course , when the justices are guided by more than the text and history of the constitution . like everyone else , the justices have imperfect instincts when it comes to measuring public attitudes . justice ruth bader ginsburg is a fervent supporter of abortion rights for women , but she has expressed reservations about the court 's decision in roe v. wade , the 1973 ruling that required all 50 states to legalize abortion . she has argued that the court interrupted a political process for legalization that was already underway , and that the case ignited a backlash that wound up hurting the cause of abortion rights . her position is debatable on several scores . abortion rights were not ascendant everywhere in the '70s , and opponents were already well mobilized . but ginsburg 's misgivings about roe have served as an important backdrop to the supreme court 's consideration of same-sex marriage . still , when it comes to supreme court decisions , it is usually safe to bet that a majority of the justices will come down on the side favored by most of the public . in any case , as we head into the argument , it looks like most of the justices have already made up their minds . after the court decided united states v. windsor in 2013 , which invalidated most of the 1996 law known as the defense of marriage act , more than a dozen federal district courts around the county said the reasoning of that case required the legalization of same-sex marriage . these judges allowed these marriages to begin taking place around the country . supporters of the existing laws went to the supreme court and asked for stays of the lower court rulings , because the justices themselves had not yet permitted the marriages to take place . but in each case , the supreme court denied the stays and allowed same-sex marriages to proceed -- those marriages are now legal in 37 states and the district of columbia . in a brief dissenting opinion from the failure to grant the stays , justice clarence thomas suggested the issue had already been settled in the minds of his colleagues . `` this acquiescence -lsb- in allowing marriages to proceed -rsb- may well be seen as a signal of the court 's intended resolution of that question , '' thomas wrote . `` this is not the proper way to discharge our ... responsibilities . '' but thomas only drew scalia to join his dissent , suggesting that even fellow conservatives chief justice john roberts and samuel alito saw the writing on the wall . in any case , at oral argument , we 'll get a clue what the justices are thinking about the issue . but we already know that their decision , like so many in the court 's history , will be based on a great deal more than the text of the constitution .",

'' apparently so was slager 's attorney , who announced after the video was made public that he was no longer representing the officer . after the video became public , the officials in north charleston deftly handled the situation . however , it was an easy case . there is no plausible evidence that slager feared for his life when scott is seen running away . in ferguson , the video we have in the death of michael brown is of press conferences with police chief tom jackson , who refused to release the police officer 's name , but did release a video that appeared to show michael brown stealing cigars . we have the video of the military weapons deployed by the police in ferguson that were trained on its residents and the press . the world seethed . north charleston 's police force is about 80 % white , with a population of 47 % black and 37 % white in the city . ferguson 's police force is 94 % white -lrb- only three of the 53 police officers are black -rrb- , and the city is 67 % black and 29 % white . both north charleston and ferguson have police forces that are not representative of the population they serve , yet because of a video north charleston 's police force got in front of the story . i 'm not sure north charleston gets here without learning something from the mistakes of ferguson . i have heard many commentators say the north charleston shooting does n't have anything to do with race . i do n't buy it . i wonder how many whites in north charleston with broken taillights get pulled over ? being pulled over for driving while black is a well-known phenomenon , which i discuss in my `` critical race theory '' casebook . racial profiling by slager could have been the catalyst for scott being pulled over in the first place . yes , the north charleston officials behaved differently than the officials in ferguson . i do n't think it 's because race had nothing to do with it . it is that perhaps the north charleston officials are better than those in ferguson when it comes to racially charged situations -- especially given the instructive fallout from brown 's shooting . and , of course , the video . it remains to be seen whether slager will be convicted of murder . strange things can happen in a jury room . recall how the rodney king videotape allowed a simi valley , california , jury to acquit the los angeles police officers , but a federal jury later convicted the officers of violating king 's civil rights . what a video proves can sometimes be in the eye of the beholder .",

'' spacex tried to land a falcon 9 on the drone ship in january , but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded . the company has previously said the odds of a successful landing are about 50 % . if you want to see how it goes , it will post photos online throughout the mission and will put video on youtube . and if the landing does n't work ? spacex says it will keep trying and , after it masters landing at sea , hopes to someday land rockets on the ground . what about the rest of the rocket and the dragon ? the smaller , top part of the rocket will carry the dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in earth 's atmosphere . the dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds -lrb- 1,950 kilograms -rrb- of supplies , including research equipment and isspresso , an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea . the space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the dragon . they 'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments , trash and other stuff to send back to earth . when they 're done , dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the pacific ocean off california . this is the sixth spacex mission to the international space station . the company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station . cnn 's catherine e. shoichet contributed to this report .",

'' the al-malahem media obituary characterized al-rubaish as a religious scholar and combat commander . a yemeni defense ministry official and two yemeni national security officials not authorized to speak on record confirmed that al-rubaish had been killed , but could not specify how he died . al-rubaish was once held by the u.s. government at its detention facility in guantanamo bay , cuba . in fact , he was among a number of detainees who sued the administration of then-president george w. bush to challenge the legality of their confinement in gitmo . he was eventually released as part of saudi arabia 's program for rehabilitating jihadist terrorists , a program that u.s. sen. jeff sessions , r-alabama , characterized as `` a failure .

'' jury selection began in january , and after a four-month process , 12 jurors and alternates , composed of 19 women and five men , were selected .",

'' in a speech before the city 's legislature , chief secretary carrie lam said that if approved , the proposal would give hong kongers the right to vote for their next leader in 2017 . the catch , of course , is candidates would have to be approved by a mostly pro-china committee . dissenting pro-democracy legislators wearing black marched from the chamber as soon as lam 's speech ended . some legislators raised yellow umbrellas , a symbol of the occupy movement . `` their fake universal suffrage is an insult to everybody 's intelligence ; that 's why we refused to stay in the chamber . '' hong kong democratic party chairwoman emily lau told cnn . lau said that she and other pro-democracy candidates would cast votes to ensure it does not become law . hong kong has become increasingly polarized over the last few years as the city fights over what kind of political system it should have as a special administrative region of china . according to the agreement signed by the united kingdom that returned the city to chinese control in 1997 , hong kong would receive 50 years of `` high autonomy '' under an arrangement called `` one country , two systems . '' part of that deal included establishing an election system based on the principles of universal suffrage . but nearly eighteen years after the handover , the city continues to fight over what universal suffrage really means . hong kong 's leaders argue its latest proposal fulfills the long-awaited promise of universal suffrage by giving each resident the right to cast a vote . all that 's left is for the legislature to approve the proposal , and then everyone can go home happy , they say . pro-democracy hong kongers beg to differ . `` if it is a genuine election , people should be free to stand and people should be free to vote , '' said lau . `` now all you have is a vote , and the candidates must be vetted by a committee consisting of business and political elites . it 's horrendous . `` to say the majority of hong kongers want to support this nonsensical package is a blatant lie . . if nothing is changed , we will definitely vote it down . '' to become law , the proposal must receive the support of two thirds of hong kong 's 70 legislators . but lau and 26 other pro-democracy legislators make up more than a third of the chamber , meaning they can veto the bill . if they do , then the city 's electoral reform process will effectively return to square one . hong kong 's leadership has warned pro-democracy legislators against the veto , saying the city might never again receive a chance for political reform . `` we must strive for consensus , '' lam told legislators . `` we sincerely hope the pan-democrats abandon their passive attitude . '' but consensus seems unlikely . hong kong and chinese leaders have repeatedly said there is no room for the proposal to change . in response , lau and other pro-democracy legislators will launch a citywide campaign this weekend to rally public opinion against the proposal . and she did not rule out the possibility of a repeat of last year 's massive street protests . `` should people decide to resort to civil disobedience again , its up to them , '' she said . `` whatever we do , our struggle must be peaceful , orderly , nonviolent . and we will do our best .

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- this is week two of an ongoing series : a catholic reads the bible this week covers the book of genesis , chapters 1-11 . a week ago , i was worried i would n't have anything to write about . now , i do n't even know where to begin . the first step was choosing a bible . i went with the version that i received for winning the religion award at rice memorial high school in south burlington , vermont . as i mentioned in the first installment of this series , i 'm a lifelong catholic who finally plans to read the bible from cover to cover . the bible i 'm reading is `` the deluxe catholic bible , '' published in 1986 by world bible publishing . after four days of reading this week , my journal is full of observations and ideas . with my crazy schedule , i found that reading at night was a perfect way to unwind and reflect . and as i started reading , i did n't want to stop . in order to fully process scripture , i need to slow down and read the footnotes . footnotes are my friend . first of all , genesis starts with two separate creation narratives . how did i not know this ? the first chapter is the seven days story with god creating the earth . in the second chapter the earth is again created and man is formed out of clay . talking with a cnn colleague , i mentioned how there seems to be fascination in genesis with dirt and clay . my colleague pointed out that even adam 's name is a play on the hebrew word `` adama , '' meaning ground . it struck me that the whole first two chapters have everything to do with the earth and man 's place in it , a struggle that we can relate to even now . from the creation of the garden of eden to the fall and the banishment , the bounty of the land and the access to it seems to be the area of highest concern . my greatest surprise , though , came when i read about seth . seth ? who ? i started asking people if they had remembered the story of seth . my unscientific poll of friends is that 9 out 10 people i asked had no idea who he was . turns out , seth is the forgotten son of adam and eve who is born after cain kills abel . adam fathered seth at 130 years old . yes , we are getting into the part of the bible with fantastical life spans that allow for the transition from the stories of adam to abraham . -lrb- again , thank you footnotes -rrb- . unfortunately , we do n't learn much more about seth . when he is mentioned , it 's about his descendants . but , because this was my first biblical surprise , i will never forget him . thank you , seth . as a woman , though i was waiting to read more about the role of women . did you know that eve is the first person named in the bible ? -lrb- i expected adam , but he is called `` man '' in the first references . -rrb- . moving on , we have these tales about the `` sons of heaven '' seeing earth 's beautiful women and taking them as wives . um ? what ? i had never heard that one before . i had to read that passage a few times and , again , the footnotes helped . they say the story is an inclusion from mythology . but why ? my first hunch is that it might have been a way to take a story that everyone knew at the time and make it part of a new narrative . familiarity would lead to followers . of course , many christians do n't cite the `` sons of heaven '' today because it would take too much time to explain . maybe that 's why i do n't ever recall hearing this passage read at mass. . with that in mind , i read about noah , descendent of seth , with a different perspective , too . i have never believed there was an ark . i never thought that god dictated the dimensions of the boat to save the animals two by two . it is a story told to make you realize the power of god . the explanation for the flood is that man had become more and more wicked , but i did n't expect , though , that god would `` regret '' creating man . ouch ! it really makes the reader want to stay on god 's good side . this `` wickedness '' of mankind and the `` regret '' from god sounds as if god made a mistake and decides to fix it , to start over , in essence . `` never again will i doom the earth because of man , since the desires of man are evil from the start . ... '' that phrase reminded me of my dad 's favorite saying , `` to err is human but to forgive is divine , '' which comes from a pope , but not a catholic holy man . but enough about that , i have to get back to reading .",

'' the webb telescope is a big probe . hubble is about the size of a school bus but jwst is as big as a tennis court . there is n't a rocket currently capable of carrying that so as chandler explained : `` it has to be folded up like a flower and then unfurled like a transformer . '' named after james e. webb , a former nasa leader , jwst is being designed to study the first stars and galaxies that formed in the early universe . nasa says that to see these objects the telescope will have to detect objects which are 10 to 100 times fainter than hubble can currently see . instead of studying visible and ultraviolet light like hubble , the jwst will work in the infra-red spectrum , allowing scientists to detect more distant targets . the new telescope requires a huge mirror of 25 square meters -lrb- about 270 square feet -rrb- -- and a golf ball of gold -lrb- about 48 grams or 1.7 ounces -rrb- to optimize it for infra-red light . it is then coated with glass . but technology like this does n't come cheap . according to nasa , the mission , which is in collaboration with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the canadian space agency -lrb- csa -rrb- and involves a total of 14 countries , will cost $ 8.5 billion . nasa says that the project has four main goals -- namely , to search for the first galaxies formed after the big bang , find out how galaxies evolved , observe the birth of stars and planets and investigate the potential for life on other planets . scientists hope the telescope will be able to tell us more about objects that formed 13 billion years ago -- about 700-800 million years after the big bang . but closer to home , scientists also believe the new telescope will able to detect planets around nearby stars . nasa says jwst should be able to operate for between five and 10 years , restricted only by the amount of fuel it has to maintain orbit and the ability of the electronics to stand up to the harsh space environment . opinion : why astronomy counts on earth .",

'' after moynihan was wounded and west killed , police and and local leaders sought to allay community concerns at a time when officer-involved shootings have led to protests throughout the nation . scott , of the black ministerial alliance of greater boston , said moynihan was shot `` assassination-style .

    "article": "catania , sicily -lrb- cnn -rrb- we are at the beginning of a massive and mounting crisis with no solution in sight . perhaps that 's incorrect . the migrant crisis that has suddenly drawn hundreds of journalists to sicily has been brewing for years , but in the past 10 days , with as many as 1,600 deaths in the mediterranean , suddenly minds are focused -- for now . almost exactly four years ago , in libya , i caught , perhaps , a glimpse of what was to come . it was late at night in the besieged city of misrata . hundreds of african migrants were caught between the libyan civil war -lrb- back then some optimistically called it a `` revolution '' -rrb- and the deep blue sea . they had come to misrata from ghana , nigeria and elsewhere , hoping to board rickety boats to cross the sea to europe . they had been pinned down under sporadic shelling from government forces , but were n't welcome by the rebels who controlled the city . they appealed to us to help them escape . we could do nothing , but they may have eventually found their way out when the fighting subsided . the fall of libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's regime , which we reporters covered so avidly , was followed by chaos , which we in the news media largely neglected , focused as we journalists were on the next catastrophe , the syrian civil war . in that chaos , the business of human trafficking has boomed . and now that boom in human misery is coming in waves to the shores of italy . the focus today is on those lost at sea . aware of the tragedy underway , however , italians are alarmed at the prospect that this year alone as many as a million migrants could arrive in europe , according to one european union official . that is certainly the case in the sicilian port of catania , where many migrants arrive . the city 's mayor , enzo bianco , insists city residents bear no ill will toward the migrants , but says catania , and sicily can not absorb the ever-growing numbers . the rest of europe must help carry the burden . `` if something serious is n't done , '' he warns , `` dramas like these will be repeated . this problem will not be resolved by hiding our heads in the sand . '' increasingly , some italians are losing their patience . two northern regions , veneto and valle d'aosta , have declared they will no longer accept new migrants . the rightist lega nord has made opposition to new migrants a pillar of its party program . others , however , insist italy must keep its doors open . in catania port , i spoke with grazia giurato , who had joined a small protest in solidarity with the migrants . `` many years ago , our grandparents emigrated , '' she recalled . `` let 's keep that in mind . '' indeed , in tougher times , millions of impoverished italians left their homeland to settle in the americas and australia . they , too , like the migrants from africa and the middle east , were fleeing grinding poverty and war . and they , too , experienced the kind of prejudice and resentment in lands their descendants now proudly call home . that 's the long view , perhaps . but now , today , italians are grappling to deal with the consequences of an array of old and new ills , ranging from failing states and failing economies to endemic corruption , hopeless poverty , oppression and injustice that no one state or group of states can solve without a gargantuan , expensive and politically daunting effort . and while this crisis has been brewing for years , it is now truly upon us .",

'' `` the way america changed after 9/11 is the way kenya will change after garissa , '' ruto said in nyeri , according to a statement from his office . al-shabaab gunmen stormed garissa university college in eastern kenya this month , killing 147 people . kenya 's government says that attack was masterminded by senior al-shabaab leader mohamed mohamud , whose `` extensive terrorist network within kenya '' extends into the sprawling dadaab complex , according to a kenyan government document given to cnn . students wake to islamist militants ' terror . ruto , who is the second highest-ranking person in kenya 's government behind president uhuru kenyatta , said his government has had discussions with united nations officials about what to do with the camp . on saturday , a u.n. high commissioner for refugees officer said the agency had not received any formal request from kenya 's government about moving dadaab . the u.n. refugee agency manages the dadaab complex , having set up the first camps there in late 1991 amid somalia 's civil war . the agency and the governments of both kenya and somalia agreed in 2013 on a process for the repatriation of somali refugees . but that was supposed to be mutually agreed-upon and voluntary , in accordance with the refugees ' `` freely expressed wish and their relevant knowledge of the conditions '' where they 'd end up , according to the pact . none of those things , it seems , applies now to the move pushed by ruto on saturday . it 's not clear where he expects the refugees to go , other than somewhere into somalia and out of kenya . any mass move would be a monumental task , disrupting the already difficult lives of more than 600,000 somalis who call the camp their home . simply meeting basic needs is a challenge in the vast complex , which has seen devastating droughts , contagious diseases and other travails that have tested its residents and those trying to help . still , as tough as conditions there are , they are seen as a better alternative to life back in somalia , where al-shabaab is based and has carried out violent attacks for years . yet the islamist extremist group has n't confined its terror to its homeland , as illustrated by the garissa attack and the 2013 siege of nairobi 's upscale westgate mall , which ended with at least 67 dead . the dadaab complex came under government scrutiny after the westgate mall attack , too . but just a few weeks later , cnn 's nima elbagir managed to go from somalia to the dadaab refugee camp undetected by taking one of the panya , or `` rat routes , '' just like many others have done , al-shabaab sympathizers among them . such illicit travel along porous borders as well as police officers ' willful ignorance of migrants ' fake ids , as acknowledged by then-interior minister ole lemku , illustrates kenya 's challenge in keeping out threats from somalia . that 's why , in addition to moving the dadaab camp , kenya is building of a 435-mile -lrb- 700-kilometer -rrb- wall covering most of the somali border from mandera to kiunga -- a wall that ruto says has begun to prevent al-shabaab elements from getting into kenya . the deputy president also vowed that any businesses collaborating with the militant group will be shut down . these measures are in addition to kenyan airstrikes on al-shabaab camps in somalia in the days after the garissa massacre . `` we must secure this country at whatever cost , even if we lose business with somalia , '' ruto said saturday . `` no politics , no games , no half-measures should apply , as the death of the 147 students must touch all kenyans .

'' `` the tin drum , '' which was published in 1959 , `` breaks the bounds of realism by having as its protagonist and narrator an infernal intelligence in the body of a three-year-old , a monster who overpowers the fellow human beings he approaches with the help of a toy drum , '' the nobel committee wrote . the committee praised grass ' mastery of the german language and his ability to artfully exploit its possibilities of creating seemingly endless yet graceful sentences . grass was an icon in contemporary german culture with an unchanging iconic look -- his broad mustache , his eyes gazing over the top of his glasses , a tobacco pipe a constant companion in hand . in his later years , he became known for his continuing critique of human history in the 20th century -- and of current events . as recently as march , grass criticized the anti-islam movement pegida , patriotic europeans against the islamization of the west . he used the opportunity fire a jab at government that he said was corrupted by money interests . `` it 's not islam that threatens the federal republic -lrb- of germany -rrb- , '' he said in an interview with rp-online . de , `` but political lobbying . democracy has decayed into fake democracy .

'' sanctions and russia 's deep economic crisis , which saw the value of the russian currency , the ruble , plunge in value by 50 % against the dollar , is set to be a major a theme . so too is foreign policy . with moscow at odds with the west over ukraine , some of the released questions show how concerned ordinary russians are about their country 's place in the world . one unidentified schoolgirl asks : `` is there a threat to russia 's interests from the united states and europe ? and will there be a new iron curtain ? '' it 's not just russian schoolchildren who want to hear putin 's answer . critics of the kremlin , of course , slam this entire event as russia 's imitation of democracy in action . it 's hard to imagine a truly critical question , they say , getting aired on national television here . in fact , its best not to look at this event as an opportunity for russians to question their leader at all . instead , it is more like a highly produced , highly choreographed chance for their leader to speak to them , and to the world . sometimes , the kremlin likes to throw in a nasty surprise , too . last year saw nsa whistleblower , edward snowden , granted asylum in russia , address putin by videolink . who knows who may pop up this time .",

'' cuba and the united states had endured a half-century of enmity , the tension worsened by the two nations being only 90 miles apart . key events of those years include some of the most traumatic in modern u.s. history , such as the cuban missile crisis , the bay of pigs and the mariel boatlift of 1980 . but the two leaders have been building up to the historic face-to-face . obama spoke by phone wednesday with the cuban leader before heading to panama . they met friday at the dinner and are expected to spend a lot more time together on saturday when the summit begins in earnest . obama arrived in panama late thursday for the conference , which in years past was tinged with animosity at cuba 's exclusion . moments after marine one , obama 's helicopter , touched down in panama city , castro 's plane landed on the same tarmac . panamanian television carried both arrivals live . during their phone call wednesday , obama and castro discussed the ongoing process of normalizing relations between the united states and cuba , according to deputy national security adviser ben rhodes . he said it `` made sense '' for the two leaders to communicate before their anticipated interactions friday and saturday . those run-ins will represent the highest-level talks between the united states and cuba since a meeting between then-vice president richard nixon and then-prime minister fidel castro in 1959 . `` we 're in new territory here , '' rhodes said on friday . `` the reason we 're here is that the president strongly believes that an approach that was focused totally on isolation , focused totally on seeking to cut off the cuban people from the united states of america had failed . '' obama was expecting a warm welcome from the dozens of countries represented at the conference , after announcing in december he was seeking to engage havana in talks over reopening embassies and removing barriers to commerce and travel . in panama , obama is expected to announce he 's removing cuba from the united states ' list of countries that sponsor terrorism , a major advance in building diplomatic ties between the two countries . the state department delivered its report on the designation to the white house on wednesday ; obama said on thursday a panel of experts was reviewing it before he makes a final determination . the white house is n't ruling out a final decision before obama leaves panama late saturday night . in remarks during a brief stopover in jamaica on thursday , obama strongly hinted he was ready to remove cuba from the list , which also includes iran , sudan and syria . `` throughout this process , our emphasis has been on the facts , '' obama said . `` so we want to make sure that given that this is a powerful tool to isolate those countries that genuinely do support terrorism , that when we make those designations we 've got strong evidence that , in fact , that 's the case . '' `` as circumstances change , then that list will change as well , '' he said . while some inside cuba have expressed dissatisfaction at the pace of the diplomatic thaw , u.s. officials say they 're pleased at the progress toward re-establishing diplomatic ties , which the white house argues has helped improve relations with other countries in the region . obama said in jamaica he `` never foresaw that immediately overnight everything would transform itself . '' the overtures to cuba have not been universally popular in the united states ; some lawmakers were irate that obama was seeking to engage what they regard as a corrupt government . even as obama landed in panama the long-standing tensions between pro- and anti-castro activists was on full display . dissidents opposed to castro 's regime were violently accosted earlier this week by supporters of the cuban government . rhodes said the white house had `` expressed serious concerns '' about the violence and would continue to speak in support of human rights reforms on the island .",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- the solar impulse 2 , the experimental plane attempting to fly around the world without using a drop of fuel , has been grounded by the weather in china . what was supposed to be an overnight pit stop in the southwestern city of chongqing has now stretched into a two-and-a-half week stay . it 's an unexpected layover that is testing the patience of the pilots and more than 60 team members , just a quarter of the way along a journey that will cover some 35,000 kilometers -lrb- 21,748 miles -rrb- over five months . `` you can believe that your will can influence the weather , '' says pilot bertrand piccard , who comes from a long family line of explorers . but `` then you 'll be really disappointed because it does n't work . `` or you just know that it 's an adventure you do with the forces of nature . '' piccard , along with andre borschberg , a swiss engineer , are taking turns flying the single-seater aircraft , which took off from abu dhabi on march 9 and has successfully flown through oman , india , and myanmar . there is much at stake . their mission , which the pilots say is aimed at proving the power of renewable energy , and inspiring innovation , has been 12 years in the making . in many ways , it has become piccard and borschberg 's raison d'etre . but so far , the solar impulse 2 has been spending a lot of time on the ground . the latest setback came when a thursday takeoff was canceled , because the cross winds in nanjing , the plane 's destination , were forecast to be too strong around its expected landing time . because of its weight , at just 2,300 kilograms -- about the same as a large suv -- the aircraft needs near perfect weather conditions , including cross winds of less than 4 knots , or about 7 kilometers an hour , in order to fly . while the team is used to waiting , they are clearly eager to move on . `` our boss is the sun , '' says solar impulse spokeswoman claudia durgnat . durgnat says there may be a tiny window ahead , with the next possible departure from chongqing on tuesday . `` it 's not good before , and the days after do n't look very clear . '' even with the delay , durgnat says , the plane technically is n't behind schedule . that 's because the team needs to wait until the end of the month for the northern hemisphere days to get longer , before the plane can venture across the pacific ocean to hawaii . with more than 17,000 solar cells along the tops of its wings and fuselage , the solar impulse 2 stores up energy during the day , in order to power the motors that carry it through the night , typically at speeds no faster than a car on a highway . inside a specially constructed tent at the end of the runway at chongqing international airport , a skeleton team of less than a dozen people works to complete the day 's tasks . the rest of the crew has been waiting for weeks in nanjing . even with the extended stay , no time is wasted . piccard spends a few hours of the afternoon in the cockpit , training to prepare for the solar impulse 's crossings over the pacific and atlantic ocean , what the team calls `` the moment of truth . '' the plane will then return to abu dhabi , where it had taken off . nearby , two technicians repair a couple of the flight computers , which display critical information in the cockpit , punching extra holes in their casings so they do n't overheat . meanwhile , borschberg has returned to switzerland to rest and get medical treatment for a migraine and a skin condition . the team expects him back in china early next week . borschberg is still scheduled to fly first leg of the pacific crossing , which could last up to five days and nights . `` the airplane is ready . the mission control center is ready . we 've been waiting for that moment since so long , '' says piccard . borschberg and piccard , who piloted an earlier version of the plane across the u.s. in 2013 , are no strangers to adventure . borschberg is a former fighter pilot , and piccard was part of the first team to circumnavigate the earth nonstop in a balloon in 1999 .",

'' `` i ca n't hide my happiness for the women but being released on bail is not the end of their ordeal , '' echoed li 's lawyer yan xin on chinese social media . `` without closing their cases , they still ca n't live without shackles -- we 'll have our work cut out for us . '' police had recommended last week that prosecutors press charges of `` assembling a crowd to disturb public order , '' which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison . the women are still considered suspects in an ongoing criminal investigation and may face charges in the future , wu 's lawyer liang xiaojun told cnn . they will be under surveillance for a year with their movements and activities restricted , and police can summon them for questioning at any time , liang added . `` this should n't be a moment of celebration , '' he said . `` the arbitrary detention and release of these women really shows the backwardness of china 's legal system . '' under china 's household registration system , only li is considered a beijing resident . police sent the other four back to their hometowns , disrupting their work and lives , according to the women 's lawyers . many have called the five members of women 's rights action group trailblazers . staging their protests through performance art or flash mobs , they highlighted feminist causes ranging from fighting domestic violence , gender equality at work , to more female public bathrooms -- drawing nationwide attention and even state media praise . their detention had drawn widespread condemnation , including from the united states . `` each and every one of us has the right to speak out against sexual harassment and the many other injustices that millions of women and girls suffer around the world , '' said john kerry , the u.s. secretary of state , in a statement friday . `` we strongly support the efforts of these activists to make progress on these challenging issues , and we believe that chinese authorities should also support them , not silence them . '' kerry 's predecessor hillary clinton -- a longtime champion of women 's rights who just announced her bid for the u.s. presidency -- called the jailing of the feminists `` inexcusable '' on twitter , joining the `` free the five '' hashtag campaign . china had rejected all international criticisms , insisting it 's a country ruled by law and that its judicial sovereignty be respected . supporters of the woman activists , however , sense the chilling effect of their ordeal on china 's nascent civil society , as the ruling communist party under president xi jinping continues to tighten its grip over the country . `` of course people will feel more afraid , '' said wei 's lawyer wang qiushi . `` women 's rights is among the most politically correct issues in china -- now even those who took up that cause ended up in jail .

'' bollinger also commented on the case in a 2014 new york magazine profile of sulkowicz , now a senior at columbia . `` this is a person who is one of my students , and i care about all of my students . and when one of them feels that she has been a victim of mistreatment , i am affected by that . this is all very painful . '' the defendants `` had the power , as well as the legal and contractual obligation '' to protect nungesser , who is also a senior , the lawsuit claims . `` by refusing to protect paul nungesser , columbia university first became a silent bystander and then turned into an active supporter of a fellow student 's harassment campaign by institutionalizing it and heralding it . '' columbia university declined to comment on the lawsuit . the school also declined to confirm the outcome of nungesser 's disciplinary proceedings . `` as we have said consistently , we do not and have not commented on individual students or disciplinary cases not only because of federal student privacy law , but also because of our ethical responsibility to ensure all current and future students have confidence that the university will never publicly discuss private matters they share when interacting with counselors and support staff , the campus disciplinary process or other resources we provide to them , '' spokesman robert hornsby said in statement . kessler also declined to comment on the lawsuit . the case has produced dueling narratives from both sides in national media outlets . the most recent came from nungesser in a daily beast article titled , `` columbia student : i did n't rape her , '' in which he shared a long exchange of facebook messages to support his claim that their sex was consensual . some of those exchanges were included in the lawsuit , but sulkowicz told cnn they were taken out of context in the suit . she also balked at the idea that nungesser would sue the school or her professor `` for allowing me to make an art piece . '' `` it 's ridiculous that he would read it as a ` bullying strategy , ' especially given his continued public attempts to smear my reputation , when really it 's just an artistic expression of the personal trauma i 've experienced at columbia , '' sulkowicz wrote in an email . `` if artists are not allowed to make art that reflects on our experiences , then how are we to heal ?

'' darpa says the so-called drone ships will be 132 feet long and likely cost about $ 20 million , significantly less than the billion-dollar manned warships currently in use . the development of the actuv aligns with the `` culture change '' described by navy secretary ray mabus tuesday at the navy league 's sea air space symposium at national harbor , maryland . `` unmanned systems , particularly autonomous ones , have to be the new normal in ever-increasing areas , '' maybus said . maybus said new staff will be put into place to help streamline , coordinate and champion unmanned systems in `` all domains .

'' but ever since , the trail went largely cold . until now . on tuesday , a franklin county grand jury indicted `` nine members of a criminal syndicate that collaborated to promote or engage in the theft ... and illegal trafficking '' of liquor from two different kentucky distilleries : frankfort 's buffalo trace -- makers of pappy -- and the nearby wild turkey distillery , makers of the eponymous bourbon , according to the indictment . just like making good bourbon -- a specific type of whiskey synonymous with the bluegrass state -- melton 's case required time to develop and old-fashioned kentucky ingenuity . the sheriff 's hunch was reflected in the indictment : of the nine named , two worked at buffalo trace and one worked at wild turkey . the alleged ringleader , according to assistant commonwealth attorney zach becker , is gilbert `` toby '' curtsinger , a 45-year-old loading dock worker at the buffalo trace distillery . curtsinger and his wife , julie , each face eight charges for allegedly engaging in organized crime . curtsinger -- who has worked at buffalo trace for more than 20 years -- was arrested in march after authorities , acting on a tip , found five barrels of bourbon behind a shed on his property , according to cnn affiliate wkyt . those barrels , weighing more than 500 pounds each and worth up to $ 6,000 apiece , had recently been stolen from wild turkey , melton told bourbonblog.com 's tom fischer . while an additional search warrant allegedly turned up illegal steroids from curtsinger 's home , there was no sign of any pappy . `` he does n't know anything about -lrb- stolen pappy van winkle -rrb- , '' his mother , teresa curtsinger , told cnn last month . in fact , she said , once he bonded out of jail , curtsinger returned to his job at buffalo trace . however , according to melton , `` curtsinger was involved in numerous thefts of pappy van winkle , as well as eagle rare bourbon , both in bottles and barrels . '' melton said curtsinger distributed the highly coveted bourbon through a network of connections in his softball league . teresa curtsinger did not immediately return a message tuesday . but gilbert curtsinger 's attorney , whitney lawson , told the courier-journal of louisville , `` we 've been waiting patiently for this to happen . we 're glad that if they 're going to indict that they 've indicted so we can get to work .

'' fischer , the whiskey blogger , got a different kind of emotional tug from what flanked the sheriff : several hundred thousand dollars ' worth of recovered booze -- including 20 cases of pappy . whether those 20 were among the 65 that vanished is not immediately known , but that did n't matter to fischer . `` on behalf of bourbon lovers everywhere , we are thrilled that the pappy is back !

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- as art , film stills are often overlooked . the photographers tend to be anonymous ; it 's easy to imagine their work done by the director or cinematographer . their images are often lumped in with the promotional machinery : whether documenting the stars frolicking on set or getting down to business , it 's just another form of salesmanship . which is why the work of ernst haas is so striking . haas , one of the 20th century 's great photojournalists and image-makers -- an early member of the great magnum photos cooperative who was famous enough in his prime to have been the subject of a museum of modern art exhibit in 1962 -- was also a regular on movie sets . it was a necessity in those early days , said john jacob , the editor of a new book of haas ' movie photography , `` ernst haas : on set . '' `` working on film sets was really important to magnum , and all of the photographers working with magnum in the '50s did films , '' says jacob , now the mcevoy family curator for photography at the smithsonian american art museum . not only did the work pay off financially , but the photographers also established relationships with members of the industry , he said . and the stars and directors knew what they were getting : some of the best in the field . photographers such as haas were entrusted to bring their talent and style to the work . the photographers `` are definitely producing work for posterity , that very much has their own fingerprint on it , '' jacob said . such distinction is obvious from looking at haas ' work -- some of which is as famous as the movies he worked on . there 's a striking picture of orson welles in 1949 's `` the third man , '' hemmed in by the darkness in a way that suggests the shadowy themes of the classic film . another , of gregory peck and chuck connors in 1958 's `` the big country , '' is as dramatic as any full-scale movie duel . -lrb- westerns were a specialty . -rrb- . but haas also has a way of documenting the artificiality of film work , whether it 's capturing the sprawling , workaday set of 1965 's `` the greatest story ever told '' or snapping a relaxed picture of barbara streisand as dolly levi in 1969 's `` hello , dolly ! '' social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . the former is particularly interesting : an image of actors splayed on crosses for the crucifixion scene , surrounded by ladders , a camera crane , a painted scrim and several casually dressed crew members . jacob observes that in each of haas ' images there 's an eye for the unusual . the black-and-white work from `` the greatest story ever told , '' for example , is almost prayerful , while the color images call attention to the artificiality of film . and some of haas ' other color images , especially his work for 1961 's `` west side story , '' fit in neatly with others in his catalog , as haas was known for an impressionistic blur of hues that jacob calls `` the haas effect . '' haas died in 1986 , and despite being celebrated during his life , his name is somewhat forgotten these days . jacob hopes that `` ernst haas : on set '' reminds people just what a master he was . `` a lot of these are familiar images , but you do n't necessarily associate them with haas , '' he said . `` on the other hand , people who know haas well do n't actually know this work , because it was work for hire and was n't ever put together in this way before .

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- is there anything laser ca n't do ? from cutting diamonds to preserving endangered sites , all the way to building terrifying weapons and turning your eyes from brown to blue , there is apparently no end to the list of applications for laser . swiss physicist jean-pierre wolf is working on yet another impressive addition to that list : using focused laser beams to affect the weather . it sounds like black magic , but it 's actually a cleaner version of cloud seeding , a form of weather modification that has been used for several years -- most famously by china in preparation for the 2008 olympics , when they launched rockets to seed the clouds and prevent rainfall during the opening ceremony . but it 's hard to tell how effective cloud seeding actually is , and it involves the spraying of chemicals into the atmosphere , something which it surely does n't need . laser is therefore a completely clean alternative to traditional cloud seeding : it 's light , and nothing but light . how does laser actually affect the weather ? just like cloud seeding , it can create new clouds where there are none , by inducing condensation : naturally occurring water vapor is condensed into droplets , and ice crystals form , mimicking the natural process that creates clouds . that way , rainfall can be triggered to `` empty '' the atmosphere and increase the potential of dry weather later on : `` we did it on a laboratory scale , we can already create clouds , but not on a macroscopic scale , so you do n't see a big cloud coming out because the laser is not powerful enough and because of a lot of technical parameters that we ca n't yet control , '' professor wolf told cnn 's nick glass . that is not to say that the laser he 's tested is n't powerful : at one terawatt , it has the same energy produced by all the nuclear power plants on earth : `` of course , it does n't last very long , '' wolf said . the technology is still in its infancy then , but once it 's perfected , it could help us modulate the weather in areas of high contrast , such as california or chile , where flooding and droughts occur in extreme vicinity . through lasers , those effects could be smoothed to have less rain in flooding-prone areas and more rain in drought-prone areas : `` you can transport the water to a different location , '' wolf said . laser seeding can make more than clouds : it can also trigger lightning . `` we also showed that it 's possible to trigger lightning in clouds , within clouds , but not to the ground , yet . '' recent tests have shown promise : '' a few years ago , in new mexico , we moved our big mobile terawatt laser to the top of a mountain and we shot it up into the atmosphere , trying to trigger lightning . we did n't , but we could see some small discharge , lightning , within the cloud . you know , 90 per cent of the lightning discharge are intra-cloud , not against the earth . so , we are still working on that , but there is hope . '' controlling lightning , or facilitating its discharge in a desired location , would help reduce the costs associated with lightning damage -- they run into the billions of dollars each year , adding to thousands of people injured or killed by lightning strikes . affecting the weather could also turn out to be one of our best bets at limiting the impact of climate change . professor wolf reckons lasers could be used to `` repair '' the weather , reducing the occurrence of hurricanes , thunderstorms , flooding , and drought . but his laser technology can look way beyond the clouds : `` there are potential applications in the biomedical field : by changing the color of the laser , we could identify and selectively kill cancer cells , with little or no collateral damage . '' yet another potential application to add to that list : `` every time you think you have done everything you can with lasers , something new comes up : it 's quite amazing . ''",

    "article": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- jackson gordon is no ordinary 21-year-old . by day he is an industrial design student at philadelphia university , but gordon has another side to him -- a side altogether darker , tougher and more enigmatic . hanging in his workshop gordon has a full suit of armor plating , cape and cowl -- matte black and built to stop a knife . gordon has an alter ego : the dark knight himself , batman . you might expect his origin story to be cloaked in mystery , but speaking to cnn gordon is quick to explain how the transformation took place . gordon says his calling came five years ago when he began experimenting with cosplay . `` previously i 'd been involved with costume making ... i 'd made a version of the batsuit from christopher nolan 's ` dark knight trilogy ' and i really liked that suit , '' gordon says . but , as elaborate as his design was , it lacked the functionality or the authenticity of the genuine article . `` i was frustrated every time i wore it , '' gordon explains . `` it really limited my mobility and i did n't like that -- it did n't go with the character . '' in september 2014 he bit the bullet , deciding `` to do another one that would n't inhibit my mobility and would actually provide protection and function more like batman 's actual suit . '' the batsuit had to be strong -- tough enough to withstand the stab or slash of a knife , the impact of a punch or a baseball bat , but light and articulate enough to make it practical . striking such a balance required expensive materials , and they did n't come cheap . gordon therefore fired up a kickstarter campaign . he `` did n't really think anyone would fund it or even be interested in it '' -- he raised $ 1,255 in 6 days . `` it was a little surprising , '' gordon demurs . writing out his shopping list , it was important that `` everywhere , even places without armor plating , had some sort of protection . '' kevlar was sourced as the base fabric , making it `` cut and slash resistant to bladed weapons , but breathable and wearable all day . '' eschewing conventional materials , gordon opted for a form of memory foam , built around key areas to `` squish and compress , '' dissipating the impact of blows . after much experimenting with `` polycarbonates and extruded pvc materials , '' 1/4 '' kydex -lrb- or abs -rrb- plastic formed the tough armor plates , located on the torso , forearms and shins . stab resistant , gordon says `` it can take anything but a gunshot . '' the cowl was more problematic , being `` nearly impossible '' to craft out of the same materials within the limits of his workshop . gordon therefore took a mold of his head using sintra plastic , `` working on top of that with different sculpting clays and soft plastics to get it into a recognizable batman shape . '' using a two part box mold gordon was able to create a `` silicone jacket '' of this , into which liquid polyurethane was poured , forming the final , `` durable and functional '' cowl . gordon -lrb- who does n't appear to be related to gotham city 's police commissioner , james gordon -rrb- is also an expert in shaolin kung fu : he is both brains and brawn , a cross between bruce wayne and batsuit designer lucius fox from nolan 's batman trilogy . legendary , the production company behind the films , has taken note of his design and given it their seal of approval . the batsuit has made appearances at conventions and proved a showstopper among his fellow students and the faculty . `` people love the theatricality of it , '' its designer says . that the product so closely mimics dc 's fantastical comic book creation has had resonance . he has already begun manufacturing the cowls for the public , with `` fully adjustable '' jackets going up for sale on his site armatus design `` in the next couple of weeks . '' the jackets have received particular attention . gordon has received `` easily over 50 requests from people , '' and not just from the cosplay community . `` they range from recreational use to martial artists ... but also motorcycle and all terrain vehicle riders who want protective gear and prefer the look and functionality of -lsb- gordon 's -rsb- suit . '' perhaps because of their versatility and the small matter of copyright issues , those that go on sale will not feature the iconic bat symbol . gordon says his fledgling business will remain small whilst he 's at university -- he has to finish he studies after all , and wo n't be using the project towards his degree credits . for now the batsuit and armatus design will remain a one man operation : such is the life of a superhero .",

    "article": "kathmandu , nepal -lrb- cnn -rrb- rescuers in nepal have pulled a man from the wreckage of a building where he was stuck for a staggering 82 hours after the devastating earthquake that hit the country saturday . his survival is unusual , as experts say it 's rare for injured people who are trapped to hold out for longer than 72 hours after a disaster . the man , rishi khanal , was saved after a french search and rescue team found him under the rubble on the outskirts of kathmandu , the capital , around noon tuesday , said pushparam k.c. , a spokesman for the armed police force of nepal . the team used specialized gear that detects signs of life , he said . but it took about 10 more hours for the french team and police officers to dig him out , the spokesman said . a police video of the rescue showed the teams drilling through concrete to reach khanal 's location and then hauling him up through the hole . they then carried him out of the ruined building on a stretcher . on wednesday afternoon , khanal , 27 , had just undergone surgery and was resting , surrounded by family and friends . he had suffered a crushed foot and was too weak and distraught to talk about his traumatic experience . `` it seems he survived by sheer willpower , '' said akhilesh shrestha , a doctor who treated khanal , according to the reuters news agency . khanal 's story of survival is n't the only one to emerge from the terrible destruction wrought by the quake , which has killed more than 5,000 people . a 4-month-old baby was rescued from a destroyed building in the town of bhaktapur at least 22 hours after the quake struck , the newspaper kathmandu today reported . a nepali military team had failed to notice the child during its search but returned after his cry was heard , the newspaper said . the little boy , whose name is sonit awal , was reported to be in stable condition without any internal injuries , according to initial examinations . cnn has n't independently confirmed sonit 's rescue , but the newspaper published photos showing the dust-caked infant being lifted by nepali soldiers in the ruined structure . tanka maya sitoula , a 40-year-old mother of four , was at home in kathmandu when the earthquake shook the city , bringing the five-story building down around her ground-floor apartment . she endured 36 long hours trapped in a room before an indian rescue team freed her . she escaped without injury , apparently protected by a beam . sitoula says she remained confident she would survive amid the rubble . `` i heard people making noise outside , so i thought i would be rescued , '' she said , as she and her family sheltered on the grounds of a nearby school . what did she do for 36 hours ? `` i was just lying down , '' she said . `` there was no room to move here and there . '' sitoula 's husband , mahendra , a butcher , said he called out for help for hours after the quake , as he could hear her shouting in the rubble of the collapsed building . it took 18 hours before the necessary help arrived , he said . and it took another 18 hours to free her . jon keisi was buried for more than 60 hours under the wreckage of a seven-story building in kathmandu that came tumbling down around him during the quake . rescue workers flown in from turkey had to help carve a tunnel deep into the debris to reach him . encased in an orange stretcher , he was lifted to safety tuesday . but he cried out in pain after his rescuers set him down , shaking his head from side to side . one of the hard-hat-wearing search team members that crowded around him called for water . keisi was injured and dehydrated , but the rescuers said they were confident he would survive . cnn 's elizabeth joseph reported from kathmandu , and cnn 's jethro mullen wrote from hong kong . cnn 's moni basu , manesh shrestha , ivan watson , tim hume and pamela boykoff contributed to this report .",

'' after a year of testing , it set sail saturday to retrace lafayette 's journey , 235 years after the original , and france gave it a sendoff with the trappings of an act of state . `` l'hermione is a luminous episode of our history . she is a champion of universal values , freedom , courage and of the friendship between france and the united states , '' french president francois hollande said in a speech . president obama , in a letter to congratulate the launch , called france `` our nation 's oldest ally . '' `` for more than two centuries , the united states and france have stood united in the freedom we owe to one another , '' he wrote . l'hermione will ply across the atlantic for 27 days en route to yorktown , virginia , where it plans to arrive in early june . after that , it will show itself off in 12 ports along the east coast . it should be in new york city for the fourth of july , possibly sharing independence day fireworks with the statue of liberty . since 1886 , that gift from france -- also a reminder of our common bond -- has been america 's quintessential national symbol of freedom .",

'' according to a police report , scott did not comply with an officer 's demands and tried to grab slager 's stun gun . slager fired eight shots , five of which struck scott . he was pronounced dead at the scene . regardless of why walter scott ran , `` running from an officer does n't result in the death penalty , '' stewart said . slager has been charged with murder , a charge that might not have come about if not for a bystander 's video of the shooting . anthony scott said he watched the video that showed his brother getting shot dead , footage that has traumatized the family . `` when i saw that video for the first time , my family was deeply hurt that someone would gun down a human being in that way , '' the brother said . `` we just could n't believe it .

'' meanwhile , residents of sanaa , witnessed the fiercest saudi strikes since the air assault started last week . military facilities , including two bases , within the city limits have been targeted , three senior security officials in sanaa said . at the security council , russia submitted a draft resolution calling for a halt to the airstrikes that a nine-country regional coalition , led by saudi arabia , has been conducting against the rebels in yemen for more than a week . the meeting adjourned with no decision announced . one diplomat said the draft was missing what the envoy called key elements . it does n't call for the houthis to stop fighting , and it does not call for political talks between the belligerents , the diplomat told cnn on condition of anonymity . yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since houthi rebels -- minority shiites who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority sunni country -- forced yemeni president abdu rabu mansour hadi from power in january . the houthis put hadi under house arrest when they overtook sanaa in january . but hadi escaped in february , fled to aden and declared himself to still be president . houthis and their allies , including those loyal to hadi 's predecessor , then fought hadi 's forces in the aden area . hadi fled aden in late march , ultimately for saudi arabia , when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city . the conflict prompted saudi arabia , a predominately sunni nation and yemen 's northern neighbor , and other arab nations to hit the rebels in yemen with airstrikes . a saudi source told cnn that special forces supplied weapons and communication equipment to yemeni fighters in aden loyal to hadi . the houthis were retreating from areas in the center of the city , including the presidential palace there , the source said . saudi special forces help oppose houthi rebels in yemen , source says . the united nations said thursday that at least 519 people have been killed in yemen in the past two weeks . an additional 1,700 have been wounded . tens of thousands have fled to nearby somalia and djibouti . in aden alone , fighting has killed 58 people and injured 200 more in the past two days , yemeni security officials said . at least 24 of the dead were houthis . complicating matters in yemen is that al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -- not the houthis or hadi-loyal forces -- holds sway in the country 's east . aqap is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization . also late this week , photos circulating on social media purported to show senior al qaeda leader khaled batarfi -- whom yemeni defense officials said militants busted out of jail on thursday -- posing in a presidential residence in southern yemen . sunni islamist fighters freed batarfi with some 270 prisoners when they overran the town of al mukallah . on saturday , the french military evacuated 44 people , including some french nationals , from the eastern yemeni port city of balhaf . cnn 's don melvin , trey haney , david shortell and richard roth contributed to this report .",

'' on the outskirts of the base are the relics of the u.s. 's military involvement in a conflict that still continues to kill afghan security forces at an accelerated rate . suvs , even old american humvees -- now gifted to afghan police to drive around -- lie disabled by mine strikes . the americans were hoping the police could stack the vehicles here , assess their resupply needs , or cannibalize the damaged vehicles for spare parts . throughout , the surreal changes in how this war was , and continues to be , fought are omnipresent . years ago , the threat would have mostly been from insurgents taking potshots at an american base . now we are far from the threat , but another has taken its place . surrounding our crew at all times are `` guardian angels '' -- u.s. soldiers on guard duty , protecting their own from rogue afghan police or soldiers , trying to prevent the newest and most serious scourge -- `` green on blue '' attacks , in which afghan security forces turn their guns on americans . it is a strange experience to be protected from those who america seeks to hand the country over to . but this is how the war ended . not with ideological victories , or dramatic withdrawals , just the slow and deliberate stepping to one side .",

'' through an emission of sound waves , sensations are projected through the air and to the user . changes in air pressure are perceived as suspended tactile surfaces , creating invisible -- but tangible -- interfaces . this already sounds quite intriguing , but paired with another rising technology it has the potential to become a game changer . the rising tide of virtual reality seems unstoppable : facebook 's oculus rift and magic leap are leading the pack , but several other companies are readying devices in a field that could shake the foundations of electronic entertainment . but even though it is incredibly convincing , virtual reality completely bypasses the sense of touch : applying ultrahaptics ' technology to it would allow users to not just see the virtual world projected in front of their eyes , but to touch it as well . tom carter , ultrahaptics ' cto , sees potential in the merging of these technologies : `` the ability to put on your virtual reality goggles and not just explore visually and through your headphones , but also touch what you can see , is a really exciting possibility , '' he told cnn 's nick glass . creating buttons and shapes literally anywhere they 're needed opens up a slew of possibilities for more traditional devices as well . `` imagine the dashboard of a car having no buttons , no switches , no ugly controls : just a very nice , sleek dashboard . `` if you 're driving and you want to have the music up for example , you do n't have to take your eyes off the road , you just hold your hand out and the controls stick to your hand , so you can feel them . '' smartphones and other popular devices could also see benefits : controlling appliances in the kitchen , using tvs and computers in a style reminiscent of the movie `` minority report '' , or even snoozing the alarm in the morning would all become just a matter of waving your hands . -lrb- this probably would n't be the most virtuous application of the technology . -rrb- . several devices can already be controlled with gestures , but ultrahaptics add an extra layer of feedback , by generating the sensation of a force field : `` haptics is more than just the sense of touch . it 's really all of the information that you get from the sense of touch . what you 're feeling , what sort of pressure , the tactile sensation given by an object or surface . you also know where your limbs are and how they 're moving , all from the sense of touch . it 's all this information that cues how you 're interacting with the world , '' carter said . to create their invisible buttons , ultrahaptics use a small collection of ultrasonic speakers , concentrating the sound waves to a specific point . sound travels through air by creating a pressure differential , so by focusing several of these differentials to a target location , the result is a single localized spot of high pressure . `` if you put your hand in the way , it actually emits enough of a force on your hand to slightly displace your skin . `` we use that and control it to vibrate your skin , and give you this feeling . what you eventually get is a sensation of vibration on your hands , '' carter explained . with the current prototype , the smallest point that can be created is 8.5 millimeters in diameter , but the shape can be morphed into a surface , creating different textures over a single `` object '' by differentiating the pressure levels . other companies are working on similar projects , such as elliptic labs , and the interest around the technology already appears to be strong . ultrahaptics , who have already built several prototypes and have demoed the technology to the public at the last ces in las vegas , say they are working with 15 to 20 clients who are looking to incorporate tactile ultrasound into their products . `` we have everything from consumer electronics companies making things like speakers , radios , alarm clocks , through home appliance companies making cooker hoods , washing machines , to virtual reality in gaming companies . and we were very surprised at how keen the automotive industry is to work with us , '' carter said . `` i 'd like to believe that the first product featuring our technology will be on the shelves in a year , that 's our aim .

'' santorum said . `` should the government force you to do that ? '' he said . `` and that 's what these cases are all about . this is about the government coming in saying , ` no -- we 're going to make you do this .

'' cardinal timothy dolan , the archbishop of the catholic archdiocese in new york , said on nbc 's `` meet the press '' on sunday that the debate over religious freedom calls for a `` delicate balance . '' `` we 've got to make sure that the rights of conscience and the ability to publicly exercise one 's religion is also balanced with another good -- namely , the rights of people not to be discriminated against , '' he said . `` it 's easier to ignore religious freedom than it is , today , the more popular issues , '' dolan said . `` in a way , i appreciate the fact that we have political leaders like gov. pence that are saying , ` whoa , wait a minute . without questioning the rights of the gay community , we also have to make sure that the rights of the religious community are protected . ' '' `` i just wish we could do that in a temperate , civil way , instead of screaming at each other , '' he said .",

'' rouhani said his government kept its word to iranians when negotiating the framework deal , which was agreed upon thursday and sets parameters for talks that could lead to a comprehensive deal by a june 30 deadline . chief among them is that iran would keep at least some centrifuges and no longer face international sanctions . he thanked iranians for their patience and for `` resisting '' by standing up for the country 's rights . as to the rest of the world , the iranian president said he thinks most now realize that iran `` is pursuing peaceful objectives . '' that means trying to develop nuclear energy , not nuclear weapons , as many feared . that fear , combined with distrust of iran 's leaders , spurred the sanctions and the middle eastern nation 's isolation . `` we do not lie , '' rouhani said , vowing that iran will be true to its word , `` provided the other parties will implement their own promises . '' what iranians think of the deal . those promises include reducing iran 's stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98 % for 15 years and significantly scaling back its number of installed centrifuges . still , while it will be shrunken and centralized , iran 's nuclear program wo n't go away . what should happen -- assuming there 's a common view that tehran is doing as required -- is that countries will end their sanctions . that was non-negotiable for iran , with rouhani saying the deal shows his government 's commitment to removing a major `` obstacle ... for business '' by addressing the world 's worries about its nuclear program . `` we need economic productivity , employment for the youth and development of non-oil products , '' he said . `` thus our people can witness better things for their welfare . '' it wo n't be easy , of course , to get iran and the p5 +1 -- the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany -- on the same page regarding the nitty-gritty details of any final agreement , if there is one . after all , it took two extra days past a self-imposed deadline for the parties to reach a framework deal . what 's in the deal ? 7 key points . that agreement followed about a decade of often failed negotiations and deep-rooted acrimony , particularly between iran and the united states . those tensions have n't disappeared , nor is there any guarantee that talks wo n't fall apart again over the next three months . even as he applauded what he called a `` good deal , '' president barack obama pointed out thursday that `` if iran cheats , the world will know it . '' his government is also being pressed by israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu , who blasted the agreement friday as posing a `` grave danger '' by legitimizing iran 's nuclear program and making it easier for iran to develop nuclear weapons . on the iranian side , foreign minister javad zarif has acknowledged that `` mutual mistrust '' has long plagued talks . he notes iran still has `` serious differences with the united states , '' even after thursday 's agreement . still , rouhani expressed hopes friday the nuclear negotiations will change that by further opening up iran to the rest of world , including long-standing adversaries . `` we do shake hands with them . ... even those countries we have tensions with , we would like an end to the animosity , '' he said . `` cooperation and interaction would be in the interest of everyone .

'' i told him we wanted to know what we 'd need to do , if we decided we did want to `` foster '' the children . he told me , `` sister , jesus will reward me , '' so the `` fostering '' was free , he said . no need for any pesky paperwork -- just a reassurance from me that the children , if i chose to take them , would `` live in my heart .

'' speaking of the allegations against him , dershowitz said tuesday : `` i hope that people will now understand that they were completely false and made up , and , nobody should believe them . '' buckingham palace , which in january emphatically denied any form of sexual contact between the duke of york and a victim it identified as virginia roberts , said prince andrew was informed of the latest developments . `` he is spending this week privately , before resuming his schedule of public engagements next week . further details will be announced in due course , '' the palace said in a statement . roberts ' attorneys were not immediately available for comment . the federal court filing alleged that `` doe 3 '' was forced to have sex with several men when she was a teenager . virginia roberts made the allegations in a civil motion filed earlier this year in u.s. district court in southern florida , joined by another unnamed woman . while roberts was not identified by name in the filing , her name was widely reported in the british news media , and buckingham palace included it in a statement . along with britain 's prince andrew and others , dershowitz was named in the federal court filing as one of the prominent people who had sexual contact with teenage girls through epstein . epstein , an investment banker , pleaded guilty some years ago in florida to a state charge of prostitution solicitation , but there were no federal charges after he and authorities signed a non-prosecution agreement . but some of epstein 's alleged victims are n't on board with the deal , thinking he should face stiffer charges and penalties . four of them took federal prosecutors to court , suing them to reopen the case because they believed their rights under the crime victims ' rights act were violated by the agreement . two of them entered the discussion in january , including the one described as jane doe 3 . the filing alleged she was a minor when epstein made her a `` sex slave '' and made `` her available for sex to politically connected and financially powerful people . '' those big names allegedly included prince andrew and dershowitz . according to the filing , `` epstein required jane doe # 3 to have sexual relations with dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor , not only in florida but also on private planes , in new york , new mexico , and the u.s. virgin islands . '' the celebrity lawyer and professor subsequently issued an adamant public denial , saying the case `` is all about money '' and `` completely made up . '' he went further in his court filings , including a sworn affidavit in which he said `` lawyers for jane doe # 3 ... leveled totally false and outrageous charges against me that have been reported around the world and threaten to damage my reputation irrevocably . '' `` never under any circumstance have i ever had any sexual contact of any kind , which includes massages or any physical contact whatsoever , with jane doe # 3 , '' he said . dershowitz said , for instance , that his wife and daughter accompanied him on his sole visit to epstein 's caribbean island as well as the one time he went to epstein 's new mexico house -- at which point it was under construction and no girls were visible . `` let me assert categorically , without reservation and with full awareness of the risks of perjury , '' he stated , `` that i did not ever , under any circumstances , have any sexual contact of any kind with jane doe # 3 .

    "article": "washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- the flight voice recorder aboard germanwings flight 9525 reportedly captured blaring cockpit alarms , warning co-pilot andreas lubitz to `` pull up '' and that `` terrain '' was ahead . but that was not enough to stop the aircraft from slamming into the french alps . with reports that lubitz apparently ignored those warnings , there are new calls from aviation experts to develop and deploy enhanced crash avoidance software that could take control of an aircraft away from a pilot and steer the plane to a safe altitude . the technology would work in a fashion similar to crash avoidance technology already used in automobiles . if a pilot is incapacitated or ignores audible warnings , the plane 's flight guidance software could take over and plot a course to a safe altitude . in cars , these avoidance systems sometimes deploy brakes or slow a car down to a safer speed , and help maintain safe distances from other vehicles . the idea is not new . in fact , more than 10 years ago , following 9/11 , airbus , the manufacturer of the doomed aircraft , was working to d evelop aircraft crash avoidance software with tech giant honeywell -- in part to prevent jetliners from being flown into large buildings or mountains . but the project was ultimately scrapped . a spokesperson for honeywell says the company has no plans to revive the project unless federal regulators demand it be put into cockpits or airlines ask for it . so far that has not happened . cnn also asked airbus about the project , but the company had no comment . former department of transportation inspector general mary schiavo says pilots , regulators and the traveling public have , so far , not bought into claims that computers can do it better . `` for any situation where you are relieving the pilot 's control of their plane , there has been pushback not only from the pilots , but from airlines . there are some sectors that believe that ultimately the pilot must maintain overall control of the plane and that that is your best bet for a safe flight . '' however , she adds , in the case of the germanwings crash , `` this technology , i believe , would have saved the flight . not only would it have saved this flight and the germanwings passengers , it would also save lives in situations where it is not a suicidal , homicidal pilot . it has implications literally for safer flight across the industry . '' pilots ' groups point to numerous instances where a pilot 's training and perhaps unconventional thinking actually saved lives . for example , in 2009 capt. c.b. sullenberger crash-landed u.s. airways flight 1549 into the hudson river in new york , after a flock of geese was sucked into both of its engines and the a320 lost all thrust . the formal national transportation safety board report on the crash said the main thing that contributed to the survivability of the accident was `` the decision-making of the flight crewmembers and their crew resource management during the accident sequence . '' in other words , when sullenberger decided to ditch the plane in the hudson , he saved the 150 passengers and five crew members on board . pilots say if a computer had taken over after it sensed the plane was headed for water , the outcome could have been very different . commercial airline pilot john barton says there are other considerations to take into account as well . `` in systems like this ... the control can not be taken back from the aircraft . or , indiscriminately the aircraft could be taken over on just a normal flight and they -lrb- cockpit crew -rrb- would n't be able to get control back . i think it is going to take a long time to operationally test this kind of technology before it is foolproof . '' he also worries that the autopilot software could be vulnerable to hackers . `` more and more people will come to know the technology . they will work on the technology and therefore there will be bad people that will be able to exploit that technology . that 's not a good thing . '' but in an incident like the germanwings tragedy , where a pilot is being blamed for the crash , schiavo says there must be additional safeguards and that this technology would be a start . `` most of the major commercial jetliner crashes in the last two or three years could have been saved with an override . '' barton says there are already plenty of safeguards in place in the united states . for example , he says , the federal aviation administration rule that two people must always be in the cockpit during a flight might also have saved the germanwings flight . that is a practice that several overseas carriers -- including germanwings and its parent company , lufthansa -- have now adopted . `` the solution to the problem simply is for the rest of the world globally to adhere to the standards that the united states has used forever , and that is sound hiring practices , safety and training and security practices . '' barton says .",
